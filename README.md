# inf1002

real phishing app (real)

## shit that is very important !!!
when you run the program please make sure you are running it from the inf1002/ folder and not any subfolder, and you are using the following command:

`python -m website`

this is for Consistency With Imports. :) (pls i have gone thru enough poly projects where this was a problem believe me)

## to-do list:
- website (flask)
- email measurement criteria (six given features, plus some more extra? for sauce?)
- database (sqlite)
- some ML nonsense
- make the website pretty
- data vis and benchmarking

## guidelines for Good Marks
- **quality of code** is important, so make sure things are commented clearly if necessary, keep things nice and clean, align with PEP8 
- type hints are a good idea
- keep everything segmented into modules ( i have created the necessary folders for the modules that we will need, such as file-parsing, data validation + processing, and the actual phishing detection funcs
- **quality of our phishing detection** is also important, gotta make sure our methodology is actually decent
- we'll want a lot of parameters by which we classify spam vs not-spam, create as many different tests as possible
- unit tests!!

## vague ideas for packages to use
- whatever machine learning module you want also can just anyhow dogshit, preferably something lighter and easier to use
- pickle for ML model serialization to disk
- regex for email / domain / ip address detection
- flask (obvi), flask-wtforms for nicer form submission
- sqlite (database handling) 
- virustotal / clamav python wrappers
- matplotlib for datavis (stretch goal)
- ... (other stuff i have not thought about yet)

## stretch goals (just things that are nice to have)
- good css (this one is personally important to me so i will handle it)
- online website hosting (just for fun)
- comparison with other existing models, visualizations with mpl

## important info
- understandably, this might be a little overwhelming for you all but do not worry, i didn't propose anything i myself am not comfortable a) implementing by myself, and b) teaching you how to do - there will be plenty of opportunities for contribution on more comprehensible, simple tasks. i'm just onz+extra as fuck, don't feel obligated to match my freak
- ask if you need help! i'm Very Approachable and Not Intimidating.

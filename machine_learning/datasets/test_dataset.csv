Michael Parker <ivqrnai@pobox.com>,SpamAssassin Dev <xrh@spamassassin.apache.org>,"Tue, 05 Aug 2008 17:31:20 -0600",Re: svn commit: r619753 - in /spamassassin/trunk: lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Util/RegistrarBoundaries.pm t/uri_text.t,"Would anyone object to removing .so from this list?  The .so TLD is  
basically dead and we've found that lots of bogus domains like lib*.so  
are being caught by this.  Also sometimes you'll have spammers who are  
putting in gibberish or funny punctuation and you'll get sentences  
like 'blah blah.So this is'.  It also occurs with a couple of other  
domains but .so is by far the worst.

For more info on the .so domain you can read about it here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.so_%28domain_name%29

The only way I have ever gotten the nvidia drivers to not hang (using swsusp, tuxonice, uswsusp, whatever) is to use suspend-to-ram after disabling whatever magic video card hackery the distro tries (on the theory that the nvidia binary driver knows more about the quirks my card has than the sleep scripts the distro uses). > Michael > > > _______________________________________________ > TuxOnIce-users mailing list > enpsfhxz-stvnz@lists.tuxonice.net > http://lists.tuxonice.net/mailman/listinfo/tuxonice-users > ------------------------------ >From nlnpr@nigel.suspend2.net  Sun Feb 24 10:27:37 2008 Message: 5 Date: Fri, 08 Feb 2008 08:10:19 +1100 From: Nigel Cunningham  Subject: Re: [TuxOnIce-users] [TuxOnIce-devel] 3.0-rc5 released.

Alternatively, you can just set the  default console level higher than 1, or change it while hibernation is  running. This assumes that you have PM_DEBUG enabled.

As input I take data from a relational database. Below is a sample from this table stored in a MySQL database. Each row represents an ""EVENT"": ID | USER_X | EVENT_Y | TIME ---------------------------- 1    USER_1   EVENT_1    t1 2    USER_1   EVENT_3    t2 3    USER_1   EVENT_10  t3 : j    USER_1   EVENT_1     t_i j+1  USER_2   EVENT_4   t_i+1 : N    USER_A   EVENT_3   t_z ID: unique for each row. USER_X: USER with X an element from the set [0 .. A) identifying a user. EVENT_Y: EVENT with Y an element from the set [0 .. B) identifying an event. Conneting to the database works fine. Now, I would like to obtain the following format: A ""User-based B-dimensional vector/dictionary"" of all events where each position in this vector space corresponds to an event and holds a binary value - 0 or 1 - indicating whether the event occured or not. So duplicates are neglected. For the sample table below with B =3D 7 (indicating that there a 7 different events, numbered 0 through 6), this might look like: ID | USER_X | EVENT_Y | TIME ---------------------------- 1    USER_1   EVENT_1   t1 2    USER_1   EVENT_3   t2 3    USER_1   EVENT_4   t3 4    USER_1   EVENT_6   t4 5    USER_2   EVENT_5   t5 USER_1: (0,1,0,1,1,0,1) USER_2: (0,0,0,0,0,1,0) I hope that someone can help me out. Kind regards, Guido Budziak -------------- next part -------------- An HTML attachment was scrubbed...

There are lots of great books available, which will present a clear and consice picture of the data mining tools, artificial intelligence methodologies or the machine learning methods, some of which are implemented in Weka. Here find listed some of the books you could use for gaining deeper insights: 1. To start with, Whitten & Frank's book on Data Mining is a great one. This is the book Weka refers to. There are also ones by Han; D. Hand on the same topic and widely used. 2. For Artificial Intelligence, Russel and Norvig; or Winston; or Knight or Charniak are widely read authors. In addition to all the books, there are a host of materials available on the internet inthe form of tutorials slides, papers, articles and even open source training material that can be very useful and also handy. MIT has a great open source tutorial, most good Universities have some teaching material posted by professors which you can read. Hope this should help, Regards, Subrat ________________________________ From: mackmusd-hbijzgs@list.scms.waikato.ac.nz [mailto:mackmusd-hbijzgs@list.scms.waikato.ac.nz] On Behalf Of Andhra Loyola College Sent: Thursday, February 07, 2008 12:13 PM To: iuxxdkqk@list.scms.waikato.ac.nz Subject: [Wekalist] where can i find algorithms explanation dear weka forum,                         I had gone through all the documentations present in source forge, but i could not find clear explanation of the algorithms.Can some one tell me where i can find them in Internet. thank u. sunanda ________________________________ Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!

# Please include the string:  [perl #46011]
# in the subject line of all future correspondence about this issue. 
# 


This is a bug report for perl from hzyoze@fysh.org,
generated with the help of perlbug 1.35 running under perl v5.8.8.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
[Please enter your report here]

This perl is configured with 64-bit integers and 64-bit floats (1+52
bits of significand).

$ perl -lwe '{ package t0; sub mynum { 36028797018963971 } use overload ""0+"" => \\&mynum } print int(t0::mynum); print int(bless({}, ""t0""))'
36028797018963971
36028797018963968
$

36028797018963971 is 2^55+3.  Its salient feature here is that it's
a native integer that can't be exactly represented as a native float.
When it's returned by the ""0+"" overload function, it's being unnecessarily
and lossily coerced to float.  This coercion doesn't happen if the
return value of t0::mynum() goes directly into int() without going via
the overloading system.

Not I.

Looks like the -x flag on du is broken.

Worst-case scenario is loss of personal data, and/or
run-away process which consumes resources (memory or
disk space if not constrained by ulimit or quota) until
there's a system crash.

What you WON'T have to do is reinstall the whole system.

You see...the whole Unix security model PRESUMED that
a user might (either unintentionally or intentionally)
write and/or execute a run-away process which could
be destructive.  Write-permissions (or lack of them)
prevent the process from doing damage to anything other
than the user's own personal files.

FWIW, the behaviour of the two examples is what I would have expected.
(Though I had to think about the second case a bit: initially I expected
it to do exactly what the first case does.)

>From perlvar:
         $
               Contains the subpattern from the corresponding set of capturing
               parentheses from the last pattern match, not counting patterns
               matched in nested blocks that have been exited already.
               (Mnemonic: like \\digits.)  These variables are all read-only
               and dynamically scoped to the current BLOCK.

It is unfortunate that the documentation does not more carefully define
what it means by ""nested block"" here: from the point of view of the read
access of $1 in the examples, the inner match is not occurring in a nested
block. From the point of view of the program as a whole, the second case
certainly contains a nested block; the first case might or might not,
depending what ""nested"" means; the first case also either might or might
not have ""exited"" its block (nested or no), depending on precisely what
""exited"" means - my own interpretation is that it hasn't exited the block
yet, but that's a sentiment based more on my limited understanding of the
implementation than on any documentation.

If we can work out what the documentation is supposed to be saying, and
what all the words mean, maybe we have a better chance of deciding whether
the implementation matches that, and if not, fixing it.

A customer is looking for a book that may have been written about the disappearance in June of 1972, of a young boy (Adrian McNaughton) in the Holmes' Lake area of Brougham Township in Renfrew County (Ottawa Valley area of Ontario). He was 6 years old at the time.

She recalls having seen something about it in the past (other than printed news reports. Perhaps a bound official report? An article in a magazine?).

Any information or leads (even a ""yes - there is"" or ""no - there isn't"") would be much appreciated.

Kindest regards - John Lynch.

to branch 3.2 and then applying the bug 5813 fix on top of it. So I'm calling

 crm -u $HOME/.crm114 mailreaver.crm --spam

To move the unsure mails to ham, if they are, I use:
 crm -u $HOME/.crm114 mailreaver.crm --good

But when I then send the same mails though the same filters again, they are still detected as UNSURE

Guess I need some help at this point. I assume that I have somewhere a problem in my setup..

Thanks a lot
Michael

In actuality, MS Windows and other products suffer chronic security
problems because MS deliberately places backdoors in their products.

Ever notice how it sometimes takes MONTHS between when a windows
security problem is first reported, and when the problem is finally
admitted, right as they are releasing the patch?

That's because sometimes it takes that long to not only close
the backdoor which the crackers have discovered, but to ALSO
*CREATE* A NEW BACKDOOR so that they can continue monitoring
(and spying upon) the customer base.

Yep.  See above.

Unix and Linux are written with the idea that multiple users
will be logged in at the same time, that all of them are
creative, but not infallible programmers, and the system
must be resiliant enough to prevent any user's faulty code
from crashing or destroying the whole system.

This is the basis of the *nix security model.



Windows is written with the idea that everybody is perfect,
and nothing bad or unexpected happens -- EVER.

This is why Windows doesn't really have a security model.

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

The Conference on Email and Anti-Spam (CEAS) invites participation in 
the CEAS Live Spam Challenge. Participants will compete in filtering a 
live 24-hour e-mail stream delivered using standard protocols (SMTP, 
IMAP4, POP3). All types of anti-spam technology are welcome including 
servers, appliances, proxies and personal filters. Participants will be 
allowed to use any network resource including real-time blacklists, 
real-time white-lists, reverse-DNS queries, and privately owned and 
updated databases.

Simulated user-feedback will be provided to train learning-based 
filters. Filters will be evaluated based on a weighted combination of 
the percentage of spam blocked and its false positive percentage.

The challenge will be held in conjunction with the Fourth Annual 
Conference on Email and Anti-Spam (CEAS). Conference registration and 
attendance is not required for participation.

Please see http://www.ceas.cc/challenge for competition details and 
instructions on joining the competition e-mail list.

Ah... the problem is the *

You're going to have to explicitly list all of the directories
that are on the root partition on the command line, WITHOUT
listing any mountpoints (/home, /usr, whatever)

By using *, you effectively said ""stay within ANY AND ALL of the
filesystems containing these directories"", including any
filesystem with a mountpoint in the / directory (i.e. /proc,

No.  Just before my mobilization began in April 2006, I
had purchased 10.0 in the store.

Then in August 2006, after we finished our pre-deployment
training, we had a 4-day pass to go home and visit for a
bit before getting deployed... which is when I found
10.1 on the shelf (put together by some outfit like
Walnut Creek or something).  I installed 10.1 in tent
in Kuwait (thank God we had electricity and air
conditioning!)

BREAKING NEWS & ALERT: 
USDA REPORT INDICATES THAT ORGANIC LABELING FRAUD IS INCREASING
The U.S. Department of Agriculture National Organic Program (NOP) announced this week that 15 of the 30 accredited organic certifiers they recently inspected failed the USDA audit and will have 12 months to make corrections or lose their accreditation with the NOP. Although the USDA euphemistically calls their enforcement actions ""renewal pending subsequent audit,"" it is clear that there are numerous violations of organic standards taking place in the U.S. and across the world. A number of the violations noted in the several hundred page audit related to Chinese imports certified by the French-based organic certifier Ecocert and other certifiers.

Strangely enough, Quality Assurance International (QAI), the largest organic certifier in the world, is not cited by the USDA, even though the OCA has recently reviewed documents that indicate that QAI is indeed under investigation by the NOP. QAI has recently been in the news for sourcing ginger, contaminated with a dangerous and banned pesticide, Aldicarb, from its Chinese certification sub-contractors and then labeling it as ""USDA Organic."" QAI is also under public fire, along with other certifiers, for certifying factory farm feedlot dairies supplying milk to Horizon and Aurora Organic Dairy, who in turn supply Wal-Mart, Costco, Safeway, and other organic private label organic milk.

ALERT OF THE WEEK: 
SENATOR SAYS STOP BRAINWASHING CHILDREN TO EAT JUNK FOOD
A new Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report has revealed that food and beverage corporations spent $1.6 billion dollars in food advertising in 2006. As parents and public health officials understand, the nation's alarming surge in childhood obesity and diabetes are directly related to increased consumption of junk food. Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) has urged industry and government regulators to redirect the massive funds spent every year in junk food advertising toward education and programs focused on healthy eating.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK:
""Globalized industrialized food is not cheap: it is too costly for the Earth, for the farmers, for our health. The Earth can no longer carry the burden of groundwater mining, pesticide pollution, disappearance of species and destabilization of the climate. Farmers can no longer carry the burden of debt, which is inevitable in industrial farming with its high costs of production. It is incapable of producing safe, culturally appropriate, tasty, quality food. And it is incapable of producing enough food for all because it is wasteful of land, water and energy. Industrial agriculture uses ten times more energy than it produces. It is thus ten times less efficient.""

Dr. Vandana Shiva, scientist, world-renowned author, and grassroots leader in India. Member of the Policy Advisory Board of the Organic Consumers Association.

PLUNDER OF THE WEEK: 
SIX TIMES MORE FISH FED TO LIVESTOCK THAN TO HUMANS
According to the UBS Fisheries Centre in Vancouver, B.C., despite rampant over-fishing and depletion of world fish populations, globally, we are now feeding 14 million tons of edible wild-caught fish to factory farm animals, like pigs and chickens, each year. That amounts to over six times the amount of fish the entire U.S. population eats annually. Wild fish fed to animals on a massive scale include perfectly edible anchovies, sardines, mackerel, and herring, which are ground into a cheap fishmeal and sold for animal feed. In other words a protein source is being fed to animals on corporate farms with a 90% energy loss. Given the global food crisis and the over-harvesting of many of the ocean's commercial fish varieties, careful analysis of resource use by the global industrial food complex is becoming a life or death imperative.

________________________________

SUSTAINABILITY TIPS OF THE WEEK: 
MICRO-GENERATION AND MICRO-FARMING
As energy and food prices continue to rise, global experts predict that micro-generation and micro-farming will boom over the next few years. New trends in urban farming, like vertical gardening and backyard chickens, can help feed households in an economical and earth friendly way. New technologies in micro-generation, powering your home with a wind turbine or solar paneling, for example, are making off-the-grid living more financially feasible than ever. In fact, priorities in Silicon Valley are already shifting from developing better microchips towards focusing on thin-film solar cells. Meanwhile, programs like 'Solar City' are offering 20% savings in solar paneling installations for neighborhoods who buy in bulk.

HOW TO STOP FAST FOOD FROM TAKING OVER YOUR CITY
The Los Angeles City Council has agreed to ban the building of new fast food restaurants in poor areas of the city. Three-quarters of the restaurants in South L.A. are fast food, and the City Council hopes the decision will attract healthier alternatives. The decision was made after area residents complained that junk food was destroying public health. The resolution is likely to be used as a model by other cities where similar citizen campaigns are launched. Learn more: http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_13834.cfm

I have a data set collected from 10 measurements (response variables)
on two groups (healthy and patient) of subjects performing 4 different
tasks. In other words there are two fixed factors (group and task),
and 10 response variables. I could analyze the data with aov() or
lme() in package nlme for each response variable separately, but since
most likely there are correlations among the 10 response variables,
would it be more meaningful to run a MANOVA? However manova() in R
seems not to allow an error term in the formula. What else can I try
for this kind of multivariate mixed model?

Also, if I want to find out which response variables (among the 10
measurements) are statistically significant in terms of acting as
indicators for group difference, what kind of statistical analysis
would help me sort them out?

Thanks in advance,
Gang

---------------
About SSL tests
---------------

An open bug about missing SSL tests (#451607) was brought up to close or keep
open. Jean-Paul Calderone mentioned an improved testing method by spawning a
'openssl s_server' for testing purposes. This sparked some talk about the
terminating of subprocesses in a cross-platform manner (See `Cross-Platform
Subprocess Termination`).

Contributing thread:

- `About SSL tests
`__

-------------------------------------
Cross-Platform Subprocess Termination
-------------------------------------

Because os.kill only works on *nix and OS X platforms, leaving Windows
platforms uncovered. Although subprocess.TerminateProcess exists for Windows
platforms, it requires the use of handles and additional overhead for use.
Support was overall given for adding a UNIX-only signal() method and a cross-
platform terminate() method to Popen instances. Nothing was said of actually
incorporating these changes into the subprocess module, although code was
given.

Contributing thread:

- (This was mixed in with the `About SSL tests` thread.)

------------------------
Extended buffer protocol
------------------------

Updates to the buffer protocol are discussed, along with the proposal pre-PEP
documenting the updates for Python 3000, but brought to Python-Dev, due so the
plans of backporting to 2.6 afterwards.

(Note: I couldn't summarize this well enough to cover much of it do any real
degree, but it is currently a Py3k issue, so maybe that is OK. If no one wants
to add to the summary, it will stay short.)

Contributing threads:

- `Extended buffer PEP
`__
- `PEP 3118: Extended buffer protocol (new version)
`__
- `Extended Buffer Protocol - simple use examples
`__

-----------------------------------------
function for counting items in a sequence
-----------------------------------------

A patch was submitted by Steven Bethard (http://bugs.python.org/1696199),
implemented a discussed collections.counts() function to provide a mapping
between items in an iterable and the number of times they appear. There were
suggested names, but none overthrew the original 'counts()' and a question of
items not appearing being counted as 0 or raising a KeyError, with 0 winning
due to a just-makes-sense factor.

Contributing thread:

- `function for counting items in a sequence
`__

----------------------------------------
context manager - generator interaction?
----------------------------------------

A problem was brought up with iterator context managers and iteration inside
the with-block raising its StopIteration, but being caught by the context
manager mechanics. It was also responded that the problem would not exist
without the use of overly broad try blocks, and this lead to the addition of
a formal note in PEP 8 about keeping narrow try blocks.

Contributing thread:

- `context manager - generator interaction?
`__

-----------------------------
proposed which.py replacement
-----------------------------

Suggestion of replacing the which.py script in the Tools directory migrated to
its proposal for inclusion into the standard library. A patch and tests have
yet to be provided.

Contributing thread:

- `proposed which.py replacement
`_

-----------------------
minidom and DOM level 2
-----------------------

What is missing for DOM Level 2 support in minidom was highlighted and
some work jumpstarted.

Contributing thread:

- `minidom and DOM level 2
`__

----------------------------------------------
test_pty.py hangs in verbose mode on Mac OS X?
----------------------------------------------

Differing buffering behavior was causing test_pty to block only in verbose
mode. Solutions may include reading to clear the buffer of child processes
before a waitpid() call.

Contributing thread:

- `test_pty.py hangs in verbose mode on Mac OS X?

Part of the issue, for me anyway, is that many of the really 
""interesting"" conversations have moved to Python-3000 and Python-ideas.

That being said: There are a few threads in the ""skipped"" section that I 
would have liked to understand better, without having to read through 
all those messages, such as the various ""decimal"" threads.

Other than that, the summaries remain very valuable. Thank you :)

Up to you.  Usually if anyone is going to reply without prodding it
happens within a 24 hours (if you send out the draft on the weekend I
tended to wait until Monday evening).

Yes, I plan to solve this by pulling them for summaries, as well. I'm
not sure at the moment if its better to pull them into one summary or
three. I would think one, with all the cross over that happens these
days. Any opinions?

Nancy Graziano <qgzon.djsmosok@gmail.com>,bspsggvwcfmo-bvbmb@lists.sourceforge.net,"Tue, 05 Aug 2008 18:35:55 -0500",[SM-USERS] SM 1.4.13 Configuration Question: Mail Domain Parameter,"Good Evening,

I have tried setting the Mail Domain parameter to our family's domain
name (my husband and I are the only ones accessing mail through our
own SM 1.4.13 installation),
and when I try to login without using our Domain extension, I get an
""Unknown User or Password Incorrect"" error. However, if I include our
Domain extension, I can login
without a problem.

Here are the specifics of my ISP/installation:


   - SM 1.4.13, manual installation
   - Installed Plugins: address_add-2.1-1.4.0, calendar_file_backend-
   1.0-2.0, shared_calendars-2.0.1-1.4.0, twc_weather-1.3p3b-RC2
   - PHP v4.4.4
   - Web Server: Apache 1.3.37 (Unix)
   - IMAP Server: IMAP c-Client Version 2004 [not sure if this is what
   you need, but it is all I could find...]
   - SMTP Server: Cannot locate
   - OS: Linux 2.6.9-55.0.2.ELsmp
   - Browsers tried: Firefox (v2.0.0.12),  IE7 (v7.0.5730.11), IE6 (
   v6.0.2900.2180.xpsp2_gdr.070227-2254)

I tried a search online at SourceForge going back a couple months (before
the announcement of SM1.4.13) but didn't find anything. Any suggestions?

Thanks in advance.
Nancy

Message-ID: <1202445584.28437.4.camel@poelzd-desktop> Content-Type: text/plain Hi  I am trying to classify a data set with 3 classes with the Multilayerperceptron algorithm using the Weka data mining programm. I am testing various parameter settings to see which one yields the best results. I am experimenting with various learning rates, momentums and delay on/off. So far most of the parameter combinations yielded good results of around 85% correctly classified instances. But every once in a while I find a combination of parameters where the classification doesnt work at all and one (sometimes even two) class(es) seems to be left out of the process and the confusion matrix looks like the following:     a    b    c   <-- classified as     0 6838    4 |    a = '(-inf-0.25]'     0 6728   72 |    b = '(0.25-0.75]'     0 2141 4952 |    c = '(0.75-inf)' I have not found a pattern in the parameters that causes this.  What can be the reason for such behaviour?

Gene Heskett <vvqn.qwwsabl@verizon.net>,zqoqi@spamassassin.apache.org,"Tue, 05 Aug 2008 18:36:31 -0500",sa-learn --ham ground rules,"Greetings;

About an hour ago, based on some comments made that the bayes database needed 
trained on ham as well as spam, and because it seemed to be forgetting some 
of the stuff I'd fed it as spam, I re-wrote that filter rule in kmail to 
launch it using one of my sorted directories from a mailing this as the 
argument.  Syntax otherwise the same as the sa-learn-spam filter.

The sa-learn --spam can process a message in 5 to 10 seconds or so, so if I've 
dropped 20 doofus mails in the spam directory and fire it off, I have it done 
and kmail is back among the living in 2-3 minutes.

But, feeding it a 'ham' directory with about 7k messages in it, turned 
sa-learn into a 100% cpu hog, incrementing the message processed number only 
about every 3 to 5 minutes. I couldn't kill it, it kept coming back and I 
must have fed it a kill -9 50 times.  Finally, one of the kills killed x too!  
But no console came back, so I had to hit the reset button.  The reboot was 
like molassses in January, so I did a power down, same story.  Same story 3 
times running, so I went and made a sandwich while it set powered down.  Then 
the reboot was normal up to e2fscking a a 372GB drive I use for amanda, the 
backup proggy.  That hung, with no indication of progress for about 20 
minutes, no marching **** or anything.  But it finally fell through and 
completed the bootup, and is running normally now but it has taken the 
majority of an hour to do this.

So what is the maximum number of files in a directory that one can feed to 
sa-learn --ham and expect it to achieve normal speed?  I vaguely recall 
feeding it my corpus of another folder it was having trouble with a year ago, 
the linux-usb list, 600 to 1k messages in it and it was finished in an hour 
that time.

The command that kmail issues to it is:
sa-learn --ham  /root/Mail/(foldername)/cur

Where foldername is whatever mailing list I want to tell it is ham.

Is this correct?  I've had it setup that way for 2 or 3 years at least and 
till now it hasn't been that much of a problem.

Actually the hash of the mbox *URI*, so it's ""mailto:""+email address
(I got caught out by this last time).

btw, the FOAF spec has a handy link to a list of sha1 generators:

After reading the Wikipedia entries for the TLDs that they list as unused, I would be in 
favor of removing all of them

  bv gb pm sj so um yt

If spammers can't use them as domains, then all including them could do would be to 
generate false positives.

The three listed as ""phaseout"", su tp yu, on the other hand, I would keep, because it 
appears from the Wikipedia articles that they are in active use either during a transition 
period or because their phaseout is being resisted.

If we can reach consensus on this, I'll make the changes to the code I committed.

EDITORS' CHOICE: HIGHLIGHTS OF THE RECENT LITERATURE


GEOLOGY: The Ups and Downs of Stress

Brooks Hanson



The Hawaiian Islands have formed sequentially as the Pacific Ocean crust 
has moved over a locus of melting in the mantle. As each island grows, the 
huge weight of cooled magma, a pile extending many kilometers above the 
ocean floor, bends the ocean crust downward. Two related large 
(Mw = 6.0 and 6.7) earthquakes struck the island of 
Hawaii on 15 October 2006 and have helped reveal important aspects of this 
process. Both earthquakes occurred in the mantle. One was particularly 
deep, 39 km below the surface, and implied local extension; the other was 
shallower, at a depth of about 19 km, and suggested lateral compression. 
Through finite-element modeling, McGovern shows that the different 
mechanisms reflect modification of the broad bending process by the 
different strengths of the lower crust and mantle, producing compression at
depths shallower than about 32 km and extension below, with strain focused 
near the depth of the deeper quake. In addition, compression at a depth of 
19 km would tend to restrict the ascent of magmas, consistent with the 
notion that the crust is being underplated by cooled magmas at this depth.

PLANT SCIENCE: Pared to the Essentials

Pamela J. Hines



The RNA world is alive and well--deeply embedded in plants. Plant viruses, 
traveling messenger RNAs, gene-silencing RNAs, these and more are the 
various guises of RNA in plants. For infectious RNAs, structural 
motifs--sequences that form hairpins and loops and bulges--are necessary 
both for RNA replication and for RNA trafficking between cells. Using a 
genome-wide mutational analysis of potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd), 
which replicates in the host cell's nucleus, Zhong et al. have 
investigated what these two processes share in terms of structural motifs. 
Potatoes produced by plants infected by this viroid are smaller and lumpier
than usual, and the viroids move through the leaf cells, into the phloem, 
and then on to distant parts. The PSTVd RNA adopts a rod-shaped structure, 
and all of the loops were essential for fully successful replication and 
trafficking. Loops toward one end of the rod and in the middle were 
critical for replication; damage to loop 11 produced viroids able to travel
well but not so apt to replicate; finally, one loop in its native state 
actually seemed to repress replication. Comparisons with other types of 
viroid RNAs hint at a conservation of structure-function relationships for 
some loops. -- PJH
Plant Cell 20, 10.1105/tpc.107.056606 (2008).




APPLIED PHYSICS: Light amid Disorder

David Voss



In semiconductors, the concept of an energy gap that separates conducting 
electrons from localized valence states is fundamental to understanding the
materials' optical and electronic properties. Researchers discovered in the
1980s that photons can behave in a similar way: Optical materials 
fabricated with just the right periodic structures exhibit energy (or 
frequency) regions where light passes through and other energy zones where 
transmission of light is blocked. Just as semiconductor band gaps lead to a
wide range of useful technological properties, photonic band gaps can do 
the same for optical materials. Researchers have assumed that in order to 
produce the photonic band gaps, high-quality crystalline materials are 
required. Edagawa et al. present computational results showing 
that amorphous diamond without lattice periodicity can also exhibit strong 
photonic band gaps. The results challenge the traditional view that 
photonic band gaps are strictly a consequence of Bragg reflection and 
interference in which electromagnetic waves are scattered from various 
planes formed by a periodic atomic lattice. Thus, a range of photonic band 
gap systems could potentially be synthesized from materials such as 
polymers, proteins, and colloids that lend themselves naturally to 
amorphous structures. -- DV
Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 13901 (2008).




PHYSICS: Profiles in Charge

Ian S. Osborne



The availability of high-power lasers emitting intense pulses over 
femtosecond and picosecond time scales enables the study of high-field 
processes such as photo-dissociation and photo-excition of atoms and 
molecules in the laboratory. Such processes are relevant across a range of 
disciplines, from the study of photoinduced chemical reactions in the 
atmosphere to the more fundamental probing of the electronic excitations in
atoms. When an intense laser pulse hits a cloud of atoms or molecules, the 
intensity profile of the laser pulse will produce a specific distribution 
of ions. After exciting a cloud of Xe atoms with intense laser pulses, 
Strohaber and Uiterwaal implement a time-of-flight technique that samples 
the pulse focal region with micrometer resolution, allowing the 
distribution of ions to be mapped out in three dimensions. On the flip 
side, the profile of the ion distributions can be used as an intensity 
sensor to aid the characterization and optimization of intense laser 
pulses. -- ISO
Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 23002 (2008).




GENOMICS: A High-Salt Lifestyle

Barbara R. Jasny



Bonneau et al. describe progress in an effort to link 
systems-level analysis to events at the molecular and organismal levels. 
Using experiments and computation, they have pooled transcriptome, 
protein-protein interaction, structural, and evolution-related data to 
generate a dynamic model of the halophilic organism Halobacterium 
salinarum. This model was trained on data sets that included more than
200 microarray experiments measuring responses to genetic perturbations and
environmental factors (oxygen, sunlight, transition metals, ultraviolet 
radiation, and desiccation and rehydration). The model, known as EGRIN 
(environment and gene regulatory influence network) represents 
transcriptional regulation for 1929 of the 2400 genes in H. 
salinarum, and it was used to predict transcriptional changes after 
environmental or genetic perturbations (or combinations thereof) that had 
been held out of the training data sets. As an example, the gene 
nhaC3 encodes a Na+ extrusion pump that allows this 
organism to grow under high-salt conditions. Analyses of a map of 
protein-DNA interactions generated from ChIP-chip data could not dissect 
which of five possible transcriptional regulators governed expression of 
the gene, yet one of these was predicted by EGRIN to have the strongest 
effect, which was confirmed in laboratory experiments. --

ENVIRONMENT: The Debt of Nations

Caroline Ash



Tracking the worldwide depletion of ecosystem resources is a complex 
international problem. Srinivasan et al. have used a simplified 
accounting framework to link populations who experience ecological damage 
to those who cause it. The largest and most blatant imbalance is the debt 
we (high-income countries) owe to low-income countries because of climate 
change. On a per capita basis, people in high-income countries are 
responsible for almost six times more greenhouse gas emissions than their 
low-income counterparts. Included in the tally is, for instance, the luxury
debt accrued by high-income consumers of farmed shrimp; this demand 
encourages the destruction of coastal mangrove trees to clear the way for 
shrimp ponds. The resulting loss of storm protection is increasing the risk
to adjacent cities as sea levels rise and coral reefs collapse (see also 
Grimm et al., Review, p. 756). 
Similarly, middle-and high-income countries consume most of the world's 
fish; nevertheless, several food-deficient African countries charge only 
modest access fees for the mining of their rich offshore fisheries. Despite
the difficulties of measurement and the need to simplify, this analysis 
raises provocative questions about the division of responsibilities for 
environmental harm. -- CA

SCIENCE SIGNALING: Hearing Essentials About Glutamate Transporters

Elizabeth M. Adler



Although three vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) have been 
identified, only two are found in identified glutamatergic neurons. In 
contrast, VGLUT3 is expressed in several populations of neurons that 
release other classical neurotransmitters, including inhibitory GABAergic 
interneurons in the hippocampus and cortex. Seal et al. found that
mice lacking VGLUT3 were profoundly deaf: They failed to show a startle 
response to loud noises and did not exhibit auditory evoked potentials. 
Electrophysiological analysis revealed a defect in signaling from the inner
hair cells (IHCs) of the cochlea to the auditory nerve, and morphological 
analysis showed abnormalities of IHC synapses. Immunofluorescence revealed 
that VGLUT3 was present in synaptic regions of the IHCs of wild-type mice. 
Whereas the conductances in the IHCs of the mice lacking VGLUT3 resembled 
those in wild-type mice, electrophysiological analysis indicated that these
neurons failed to release glutamate. The authors conclude that VGLUT3 is 
essential for hearing and plays an important role in the regulation of 
cortical excitability. -- EMA

PST, 5pm GMT)
for a new webinar discussing miRNAs and Cancer.  The role of miRNAs in 
human
disease, including cancer, is now well established.  Many questions 
remain
however, such as precisely how miRNAs exert their effects, whether they 
make
suitable biomarkers, and how they could be applied therapeutically.  Join 
our
three expert panelists as they discuss current research on miRNAs important
in
tumorigenesis, as well as techniques for miRNA discovery and profiling.
Time is running out!  Register today:  www.sciencemag.org/webinar

Produced by the AAAS/Science Business Office and sponsored by 
Stratagene,
an Agilent Technologies company.

. Hmm. I wonder if the admin of Flagler 
College in St. Augustine, FL knows that some adolescent-type is posting pesky 
rude messages here and there in several different newsgroups. It is against 
the netiquette and the guidelines of alt.spam to post spamthisaddress messages
here. Don't do that. Grow up. - Thurs, Feb 7 2008 4:08 pm

All that shows is their external address.  They use NAT.  Anyway, it's
academic - netops seems to have found it and pulled it offline.

(' UID 1967)',) I decided last week to try to debug this a little bit myself.  I know almost nothing about the workings of IMAP, but the problem appears to be that sb_imapfilter isn't accounting for responses like this one:   [     (       '6 (BODY[] {3130}'     , 'Return-Path: <MAILER-DAEMON...about 3000 characters snipped...'     )    , ' UID 6)'   ] In particular, that last fragment is where sb_imapfilter gets upset. I don't know whether the real bug is in whatever gets passed to sb_imapfilter to be used as its ""server"" attribute, or whether it's here, but if you look carefully at the response data structure above, which is passed back from the server object to sb_imapfilter, you'll see that the parenthesization that was in the original text coming back from the real IMAP server (i.e. a computer) is ""violated"" by the data structure, which leads me to believe that the problem might be in whatever is parsing that response into the data structure (the server object, I presume)... although I'm not sure what it is actually supposed to be doing in this case, so it's hard to say The following patch (which, given my scant knowledge, is almost certainly wrong) makes the problem disappear for me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:  https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=498105&aid=1707814&group_id=61702",0,1

------- Additional Comments From wrzzpv@sidney.com  2008-02-08 01:10 -------
(reply to comment 4)

> using the official TLD table should usually be preferred

I see I didn't make explicit in comment 2 what I did for the attachment 4257.
That patch does what I talked about in comment 1, i.e., it fixes the table in
Util/RegistrarBoundaries.pm to match the official TLD table at
http://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt with the exception of the IDN
test entries, and it redoes the regexp in PerMsgStatus.pm to be the Regexp::List
optimized form of that table.

However, I should mention the discussion from the sa-dev list in which it was
pointed out that there are some TLDs that are defunct, with no domains or active
registrar. These are bv gb pm sj so um yt which perhaps should be rmoved from
the list because they cannot point to a valid URL or mail address, so could only
cause FPs.

Elizabeth Mattijsen <ifk@dijkmat.nl>,qtog3-epoawmh@perl.org,"Wed, 06 Aug 2008 01:39:46 +0200",caller() info in DESTROY off?,"While investigating some issues with regards to object destruction, I 
came upon this little oddity.  Take this program:

= foo ================================================
sub Foo::DESTROY {
     (undef, $filename, $line) = caller;
     print ""called from $filename, line $line\\n""
}

my $foo = bless {}, 'Foo';
undef $foo;  # destruction *not* reported at this line

my $bar;     # line at which destruction of object is reported
======================================================

If you run this, you get:

   called from foo, line 9


It seems that the caller info is pointing to the next ""executable"" 
line (line 9), rather than where the actual destruction is taking 
place (line 7). Well, at least where the destruction is taking place 
from a ""naive"" user's point of view.  ;-)


I assume this is basically the way it is, right?  Seems to be like 
this in every version of Perl I could get my hands on.

Quantum Phase via Geometry




The phase of a wave function collapses when measurements are made, so 
additional information is needed to determine phase, and several methods 
have been developed based on interference with reference waves. Moon 
et al. (p. 782) 
describe a non-interferometric approach to phase-determination based on the
isospectrality, which describes pairs of simple polygonal shapes that have 
the same frequency response--that is, if these shapes were drumheads, they 
could sound the same and be indistinguishable. The authors used scanning 
tunneling microscopy to position CO molecules on the Cu(111) surface at 
cryogenic temperatures to bound isospectral shapes. Despite the imperfect 
nature of this boundary, the spectral fingerprints of the two-dimensional 
electronic states in the terahertz range were the same within experimental 
error. The authors then used this property to extract the wave function 
phase. Phase extraction should be possible in two-dimensional quantum 
systems provided that the boundary shapes can be constructed.

Spin Hall Effect of Light




Hall effects manifest as the transverse movements of carriers of electronic
current in the presence of an external field, and recent work has 
concentrated on the spin Hall effect, in which the effects depend on the 
spin of the electron and not just its charge. Hosten and Kwiat (p. 
787,
published online 10 January; see the Perspective by Resch) 
now report on the observation of an optical version of the spin Hall effect
that developed a sensitive metrological technique capable of detecting 
displacements on the angstrom scale. When light refracts at an air-glass 
interface, there is an additional displacement of the light that depends on
polarization. In this optical system, the polarization of the light 
interacts with a refractive index gradient in a manner analogous to how 
electronic spins are affected by electric fields.




Moving with the Heat




Most materials have a positive coefficient of thermal expansion--they 
expand when heated--but there are exceptions, such as cubic zirconium 
tungstate, which will contract over a wide temperature range. Silver(I) 
hexacyanocobaltate( III) is a framework material that has highly 
underconstrained Co-CN-Ag-NC-Co linkages. Goodwin et al. 
(p. 794) 
find that over a wide temperature range, this material can either contract 
or expand along orthogonal lattice directions with a coefficient an order 
of magnitude greater than that of most materials. They attribute these 
large movements to the framework flexing like a hinged lattice, of the sort
commonly seen in garden fencing.

AL.




Every Step You Take




As we walk, we expend energy not only in pushing off with our planted leg 
but also when our other leg decelerates as it makes contact with the 
ground. Donelan et al. (p. 807) 
have developed a mechanical device to harvest some of the expended energy 
in this deceleration step in much the same fashion as hybrid automobiles 
utilize regenerative braking. The device is light, fastens at the knee, and
produces about 5 watts of power, potentially enough power to charge 
portable medical devices.




Bonds, Shaken and Sliced




Soon after the development of narrow-frequency laser sources, chemists 
attempted to use these sources to excite specific chemical bonds. 
Unfortunately, the deposited energy usually spread around the rest of the 
molecular framework too rapidly for the chosen bond to break. More 
recently, studies have shown that if collisions with other molecules or 
catalytic surfaces occur soon enough after vibrational excitation, reaction
efficiencies can be selectively enhanced. Killelea et al. 
(p. 790; 
see the Perspective by Mullins and
Sitz) now take this approach a step further to show that by exciting 
the C-H stretch in the CHD3 isotopomer of methane just prior to 
collision with a nickel surface, they can achieve a 30:1 ratio of C-H to 
C-D bond cleavage, relative to a 1:3 ratio in a thermally equilibrated 
sample. Quantification of this selective scission required a technically 
demanding mass-resolved detection scheme of thermally desorbed products.




Sounding Out Earth's Core




Earth's solid inner core is predominantly a phase of iron at high 
pressures. One important clue for determining the properties of the core is
that sound waves passing through Earth's solid inner core propagate fastest
along the north-south direction, which suggests that there is a preferred 
alignment of iron crystals. Belonoshko et al. (p. 797) 
present numerical calculations which show that the body-centered cubic form
of iron is strongly anisotropic to seismic waves and can match the observed
12% anisotropy, whereas the hexagonal close-packed form, previously thought
to make up the inner core, is not.




Mixed-Up Microflora




The relationship between an animal host and the complex mixture of microbes
it carries in its gut is a delicate one, and the exact role the host immune
system plays in maintaining commensal homeostasis remains unclear. Ryu 
et al. (p. 777, 
see the Perspective by Silverman 
and Paquette; published online 24 January) examined the expression of 
antimicrobial proteins in the gut of the fruit fly, Drosophila 
melanogaster. Although the key immune transcriptional regulator 
nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) was chronically activated in the flies by 
indigenous gut microflora, only a subset of NF-B-regulated antimicrobial genes was actually expressed
because of transcriptional repression exerted by the intestinal homeobox 
gene Caudal. Disruption of Caudal expression resulted in the 
expression of a different subset of antimicrobial peptides, as well as a 
dramatic change in the composition of the intestinal microflora that led to
the apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells and loss of host viability.




What a Tangled Food Web We Weave




Both direct and indirect effects can mediate bottom-up influences on the 
diversity and complexity of a food web. Bukovinszky et al. 
(p. 804) 
compared the effects of two related plants (domestic Brussels sprouts and 
feral Brassica) on their aphid herbivores, the aphids' parasitoid 
wasps, and the wasps' secondary parasitoids to examine how resource quality
affects food web structure and complexity. In this multilevel trophic 
system, differences in the resource base cascaded through the system, via 
an array of direct and indirect effects, and led to substantial differences
in the structure and complexity of the resulting food webs.




A Growing Role for Centrosomes




Genetic analyses of individuals with extreme forms of short stature can 
provide insights into the biological mechanisms regulating human growth. 
Rauch et al. (p. 816, 
published online 3 January; see the Perspective by Delaval and
Doxsey) have identified a mutant gene responsible for microcephalic 
osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II (MOPD II). Adults with this 
rare inherited condition reach an average height of 100 centimeters, and 
although their brain is comparable in size to that of a three-month-old 
baby, they are of nearnormal intelligence. The culprit gene is 
PCNT, which encodes pericentrin, a centrosomal protein implicated 
in mitotic spindle anchoring and chromosome separation during cell 
division. Although the precise mechanisms by which the cellular phenotype 
produces the size phenotype remains to be determined, it is intriguing that
other inherited forms of microcephaly (disorders characterized by small 
brain size) have likewise been genetically linked to centrosomal and 
mitotic spindle genes.

AL.




Tipping the Balance in T Cell Decisions




In the thymus, key developmental decisions are made that have far-reaching 
consequences for the immune system, perhaps most notable the commitment of 
thymocytes to becoming CD4 (helper) or CD8 (cytotoxic) T cells. The 
transcriptional factor Th-POK commits thymocytes that still express both 
CD4 and CD8 co-receptors to becoming CD4 T cells, but how is the alternate 
developmental option generated? Setoguchi et al. (p. 822) 
find that cells that would otherwise be destined to become CD8+ T cells can
be redirected to the CD4 lineage by loss of members of another 
transcription factor family, Runx. It seems that under normal 
circumstances, the Runx complex represses Th-POK expression and allows CD8 
T cells to emerge.




The Heme Balancing Act




Heme, a component of several hemoproteins, is required in aerobic cells for
oxygen transport and storage (hemoglobin and myoglobin), electron transfer 
and drug metabolism (cytochromes), and signal transduction (nitric oxide 
synthases). However, free heme is toxic, so its intracellular concentration
must be carefully regulated. Keel et al. (p. 825) 
have generated mice lacking the heme export protein FLVCR (feline leukemia 
virus, subgroup C, receptor), and show that this factor is required for 
terminal red blood cell development. They suggest that heme toxicity may be
a common pathophysiology in some erythroid disorders where 
free-heme-balance is perturbed. Additionally, FLVCR functions in the 
recycling of heme-iron from senescent red cells, and heme-iron trafficking 
via FLVCR is involved in systemic iron homeostasis.




Uneven Heat Gain




Recent global warming will not be, and has not been, uniform across all 
regions. In order to predict more accurately what the impacts of warming 
will be, the spatial pattern of temperature change needs to be understood. 
Lozier et al. (p. 800, 
published online 3 January) examined how the North Atlantic has gained heat
during the past 50 years. The total amount of heat gained within the basin 
is approximately what would be expected, but the tropics and subtropics 
have warmed while the sub-polar ocean has cooled. These results are 
interpreted with the help of an ocean general circulation model to be 
mostly the result of wind and buoyancy forcing associated with the North 
Atlantic Oscillation. Although the spatial pattern of temperature change in
the North Atlantic does not directly reflect global warming, it may be the 
indirect result of warming as transmitted through large-scale changes in 
atmospheric circulation.




Nanoscale 3D Imaging




""Super-resolution"" fluorescence microscopy methods are capable of
breaking the diffraction limit of resolution in conventional light 
microscopy of 200 to 300 nanometers (nm). These techniques have improved 
two-dimensional (2D) image resolution, but achieving 3D nanoscale 
resolution has remained a challenge. Huang et al. (p. 810, 
published online 3 January) have used an optical astigmatism method to 
develop 3D stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM). They 
examined intracellular clathrin-coated pits and microtubules with an image 
resolution of 20 to 30 nm in the lateral dimensions and 50 to 60 nm in the 
axial dimension in fixed cells.




Specifying Gene Expression




The efficiency of gene transcription by RNA polymerase II is modulated by 
the composition of promoter chromatin, including the presence of 
nucleosome-binding proteins. Using a genomic approach, Krishnakumar 
et al. (p. 819) 
show that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and the linker histone H1,
two nucleosome-binding proteins that compete for binding to nucleosomes in 
vitro, exhibit a reciprocal pattern of binding at many promoters in vivo. 
At positively regulated promoters, PARP-1 is bound but H1 is not. Thus, 
promoter localization patterns of nucleosome-binding factors can specify 
global gene expression outcomes in vivo.




Relatedness and Reproductive Success




It appears that marrying your cousin may not be such a bad idea, provided 
there is sufficient distance in the degree of your relatedness. Helgason
et al. (p. 813) 
analyzed recorded genealogies of 10 generations of Icelanders to test the 
effect of relatedness on reproductive success. Marriages between third and 
fourth cousins produced more children and more grandchildren than marriages
between more highly related or less related people. Icelandic society has 
urbanized during the past 200 years with rural populations moving into 
urban areas, and the relatedness of married couples has diminished, which 
has been accompanied by a drop in reproductive success.

Well, the destruction technically happens *after* the undef
instruction has finished. So the current COP points at the next
statement. Which might be far away... or might even not have a line
number associated to it. That happens if the undef() call is done at
the end of an END block.

I understand that might be not practical, but that's the first time I
hear about this problem and I don't have really an idea about a
possible and efficient solution.

I've played on and off with pumps, weights, and exercises for the last few years and have never gained one centimeter. I recently began LNH Maxdik and was pleasantly surprised to see that this product actually works. I have been on the product 2 months now and I have already gained 1 inch. Its fantastic!

I would let a lap DS surgeon get 50 procedures under his belt before I would put myself at his mercy. Let someone else be the trial dummies. Get someone experienced.

(I spoke with a lady who had a consult with him who was set on the DS - he did a pretty aggressive sell on distal RNY to her.  She ended up choosing a different surgeon.)  That's been quite some time ago now, though. The list at www.duodenalswitch.com   is the list of surgeons I would consider sound.  There are a lot of surgeons who will put themselves out there as doing the DS or having been trained in it - when they truly are not pro-DS at all.  OH's list is notorious for those types of listings.  I know they tried to clean the list up a bit about a year ago or so, but it's still concerning to me that so many people get fed a TON of misinformation about the DS when they contact some of those listed there! Maybe it would be a good idea to call their office and ask some pointed questions: 1.	Does the doctor offer the DS as a surgical procedure? 2.	If so, how many DS surgeries has he done (total)? 3.	How many open?  How many lap? 4.	How many Lap DS surgeries has he done in the past year? 5.	How many surgeries that started out Lap were converted to open? 6.	What type of post-op follow-up does he have for DS post-ops? 7.	How many of his DS post-ops are willing to speak to prospective patients? 8.	Can he share information about his feelings about surgical specs? (I.e., what size gastric sleeve does he leave?  What length alimentary limb? What length common channel?) Just to name a few.

I think it is much more important to find out how good your surgeon is as opposed to how my procedures they have done.

It's my understanding that he's not working with Dr. Oh any longer. He had done more than a few DS when he was practicing in California and I had heard he was not opposed to the DS, and had wondered why so few folks in Washington were interested in the DS. I think he's done more DS, sure not certain about the lap numbers, though. Washington could sure use a good DS surgeon that was regularly performing the DS, that's for sure!

"""xup@linuxgazette.net (via RT)"" <veyjhby-fbuaeanj@perl.org>",ozip-dhyivplsb@netlabs.develooper.com,"Tue, 05 Aug 2008 11:34:32 -0700",[perl #46019] Documentation for 'srand' has a problem in code snippet ,"# New Ticket Created by  xup@linuxgazette.net 
# Please include the string:  [perl #46019]
# in the subject line of all future correspondence about this issue. 
# 



This is a bug report for perl from xup@linuxgazette.net,
generated with the help of perlbug 1.35 running under perl v5.8.7.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
[Please enter your report here]


""perldoc -f srand"" (and consequently, perlfunc.pod) contains the following:

``
  Note that you need something much more random than the default
  seed for cryptographic purposes. Checksumming the compressed
  output of one or more rapidly changing operating system status
  programs is the usual method. For example:

      srand (time ^ $$ ^ unpack ""%L*"", `ps axww | gzip`);
''

The problem is that 'ps axww | gzip' returns the same output every time, at
least on my system:

``
ben@Tyr:~$ ps axww|gzip
gzip: compressed data not written to a terminal. Use -f to force compression.
For help, type: gzip -h
''

The solution suggested in the error message (i.e., 'ps axww | gzip -f')
works fine.

Ben Okopnik

I am using RHEL 4 with postfix postfix-2.2.10-1.RHEL4.2. The authentication
is being done using openldap and courier packages are being used for pop and
imap. Maildrop is the mail delivery agent. The packages details are given

I have implemented SASL authetication. Trend Micro Net Suit is being used as
the anti spam/anti virus software. Since last few days I am finding that
some of the users (out of total 900+ users 3 has reported the issue so far)
are not able to send mail to any address outside of my domain. The log entry
that I am getting is something like

Feb  8 15:54:29 mail postfix/smtpd[9334]: NOQUEUE: reject: RCPT from
unknown[59.183.54.228]: 554 : Recipient address
rejected: Access denied; from=

>From the log I can see that many mails are getting delivered to outside
domains without any problems. But the users who are getting the problem are
not able to send any mail to outside world. But these same users are able to
send mail to anyplace when they use IMAP. For web interface I am using
squirrelmail.

Last year the conference featured a ""Geeks and Suits"" event for career

Foster as the ""godfather"" of Grid Computing, Craig Neville-Manning from

=============
Announcements

Summaries
=========

---------------
About SSL tests
---------------

An open bug about missing SSL tests (#451607) was brought up to close or keep
open. Jean-Paul Calderone mentioned an improved testing method by spawning a
'openssl s_server' for testing purposes. This sparked some talk about the
terminating of subprocesses in a cross-platform manner (See `Cross-Platform
Subprocess Termination`).

Contributing thread:

- `About SSL tests
`__

-------------------------------------
Cross-Platform Subprocess Termination
-------------------------------------

Because os.kill only works on *nix and OS X platforms, leaving Windows
platforms uncovered. Although subprocess.TerminateProcess exists for Windows
platforms, it requires the use of handles and additional overhead for use.
Support was overall given for adding a UNIX-only signal() method and a cross-
platform terminate() method to Popen instances. Nothing was said of actually
incorporating these changes into the subprocess module, although code was
given.

Contributing thread:

- (This was mixed in with the `About SSL tests` thread.)

------------------------
Extended buffer protocol
------------------------

Updates to the buffer protocol are discussed, along with the proposal pre-PEP
documenting the updates for Python 3000, but brought to Python-Dev, due so the
plans of backporting to 2.6 afterwards.

(Note: I couldn't summarize this well enough to cover much of it do any real
degree, but it is currently a Py3k issue, so maybe that is OK. If no one wants
to add to the summary, it will stay short.)

Contributing threads:

- `Extended buffer PEP
`__
- `PEP 3118: Extended buffer protocol (new version)
`__
- `Extended Buffer Protocol - simple use examples
`__

-----------------------------------------
function for counting items in a sequence
-----------------------------------------

A patch was submitted by Steven Bethard (http://bugs.python.org/1696199),
implemented a discussed collections.counts() function to provide a mapping
between items in an iterable and the number of times they appear. There were
suggested names, but none overthrew the original 'counts()' and a question of
items not appearing being counted as 0 or raising a KeyError, with 0 winning
due to a just-makes-sense factor.

Contributing thread:

- `function for counting items in a sequence
`__

----------------------------------------
context manager - generator interaction?
----------------------------------------

A problem was brought up with iterator context managers and iteration inside
the with-block raising its StopIteration, but being caught by the context
manager mechanics. It was also responded that the problem would not exist
without the use of overly broad try blocks, and this lead to the addition of
a formal note in PEP 8 about keeping narrow try blocks.

Contributing thread:

- `context manager - generator interaction?
`__

-----------------------------
proposed which.py replacement
-----------------------------

Suggestion of replacing the which.py script in the Tools directory migrated to
its proposal for inclusion into the standard library. A patch and tests have
yet to be provided.

Contributing thread:

- `proposed which.py replacement
`_

-----------------------
minidom and DOM level 2
-----------------------

What is missing for DOM Level 2 support in minidom was highlighted and
some work jumpstarted.

Contributing thread:

- `minidom and DOM level 2
`__

----------------------------------------------
test_pty.py hangs in verbose mode on Mac OS X?
----------------------------------------------

Differing buffering behavior was causing test_pty to block only in verbose
mode. Solutions may include reading to clear the buffer of child processes
before a waitpid() call.

Contributing thread:

- `test_pty.py hangs in verbose mode on Mac OS X?
`__

-------------------------
HTTP Responses and Errors
-------------------------

In 2xx HTTP responses mean that the request was handled OK.  The
existing library was special-casing the most common responses and
treating others as errors.  After verifying that there wasn't a good
reason for the old behavior, Facundo Batista fixed it.

Contributing thread:

- `HTTP responses and errors
`__

------------------------
Build Problem on Windows
------------------------

It is a generated file; the actual problem is in make_buildinfo

Contributing thread:

- `build problem on windows: unable to find getbuildinfo2.c
`__

--------------------------
BaseException Pickle Issue
--------------------------

Exceptions are now new-style classes; this caused some obscure
problems with picking and unpickling.

   http://www.python.org/sf/1498571

and later

   http://www.python.org/sf/1692335

should resolve the issue.

Contributing thread:

- `BaseException pickle issue
`__

---------------------------------
Deprecating BaseException.message
---------------------------------

Plans changed; BaseException will still accept an args tuple, so don't
bother with the .message attribute. Probably the shorted leaved Python
feature ever. See PEP 352.

Contributing thread:

- `deprecating BaseException.message
`__

---------------------
Changes to decimal.py
---------------------

The external standard has been updated; python's implementation will
be updated to match.

Contributing threads:

- `Changes to decimal.py
`__
- `Fwd: Re: Changes to decimal.py
`__

----------------------------------------
Pydoc Rewrite Discussion at doc-sig list
----------------------------------------

An announcement that the (normally quiet) doc-sig mailing list would
be discussing a rewrite of pydoc.
http://mail.python.org/pipermail/doc-sig/

Contributing thread:

- `Pydoc Rewrite Discussion at doc-sig list.
`__

------------------------------
Making builtins more efficient
------------------------------

Andrea Griffini posted a patch at sourceforge that makes builtin
lookups almost as fast as locals.

https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=305470&aid=1616125&group_id=5470

------- Additional Comments From wrzzpv@sidney.com  2008-02-08 02:58 -------
Here is a summary of comments from sa-dev that should be here for the record:

  -----------

Michael Parker said:

Would anyone object to removing .so from this list?  The .so TLD is  
basically dead and we've found that lots of bogus domains like lib*.so  
are being caught by this.  Also sometimes you'll have spammers who are  
putting in gibberish or funny punctuation and you'll get sentences  
like 'blah blah.So this is'.  It also occurs with a couple of other  
domains but .so is by far the worst.

For more info on the .so domain you can read about it here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.so_%28domain_name%29

 ------------

To which I replied:

After reading the Wikipedia entries for the TLDs that they list as unused, I
would be in 
favor of removing all of them

  bv gb pm sj so um yt

If spammers can't use them as domains, then all including them could do would be to 
generate false positives.

The three listed as ""phaseout"", su tp yu, on the other hand, I would keep,
because it 
appears from the Wikipedia articles that they are in active use either during a
transition 
period or because their phaseout is being resisted.

If we can reach consensus on this, I'll make the changes to the code I committed.

 ---------------------

And then Justin Mason said:

I'm happy enough with that. btw this discussion should be on
a bug...

Sorry if this comes through as a dupe, the first I accidentally left html formatting on. --  Richard Ahlquist Systems Analyst ------------------------------ >From sfwrk@ummm-beer.com  Sun Feb 24 10:27:38 2008 Message: 3 Date: Thu, 07 Feb 2008 08:27:28 -0500 From: Rick Macdougall  Subject: [Clamav-users] Clamdscan not find viruses To: ClamAV users ML  Message-ID: <47AB0740.30008@ummm-beer.com> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed Hi, I have another example where clamdscan fails to find a virus but  clamscan does.

Once you know that it  may be possible to decode the pattern to discover what is being found in  your logwatch mail. It may also be possible to instruct your system to  not scan mail from logwatch. dp ------------------------------ >From buddgrbonu@gmail.com  Sun Feb 24 10:27:38 2008 Message: 5 Date: Thu, 07 Feb 2008 16:20:40 +0200 From: T?r?k Edwin  Subject: Re: [Clamav-users] Clamdscan not find viruses To: ClamAV users ML  Message-ID: <47AB13B8.1020406@gmail.com> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1 Rick Macdougall wrote: > Hi, > > I have another example where clamdscan fails to find a virus but  > clamscan does. > > > I have a copy of the message in question if one of the devs would like a  > copy. > >    Please open a bugreport, and attach the sample (marked as private).

PhishingScanURLs was no (hard coded), changing it to yes  makes clamdscan see it. How ever the reason I saw it was because a message came in on mail  server 3 last night and was not caught, but the message was then  forwarded to a user on mail server 2 where it was rejected by clamdscan. Now, mail server 2 did not see the virus this morning when I checked it  again but it obviously did last night when PhishingScanURLs = no. Any reason for that that you can see ?

Join us February 20, 2008, at 12 noon Eastern Standard Time (9am PST, 5pm GMT)
for a new webinar discussing miRNAs and Cancer.  The role of miRNAs in human
disease, including cancer, is now well established.  Many questions remain
however, such as precisely how miRNAs exert their effects, whether they make
suitable biomarkers, and how they could be applied therapeutically.  Join our
three expert panelists as they discuss current research on miRNAs important in
tumorigenesis, as well as techniques for miRNA discovery and profiling.
Time is running out!  Register today:  www.sciencemag.org/webinar 
Produced by the AAAS/Science Business Office and sponsored by Stratagene,
an Agilent Technologies company.

- - - - - miRNAs and Cancer Webinar brought to you by Science - - - - - 
Join us February 20, 2008, at 12 noon Eastern Standard Time (9am PST, 5pm GMT)
for a new webinar discussing miRNAs and Cancer.  The role of miRNAs in human
disease, including cancer, is now well established.  Many questions remain
however, such as precisely how miRNAs exert their effects, whether they make
suitable biomarkers, and how they could be applied therapeutically.  Join our
three expert panelists as they discuss current research on miRNAs important in
tumorigenesis, as well as techniques for miRNA discovery and profiling.
Time is running out!  Register today:  www.sciencemag.org/webinar 
Produced by the AAAS/Science Business Office and sponsored by Stratagene,
an Agilent Technologies company.

           Summary: New TLD .rs
           Product: Spamassassin
           Version: 3.2.4
          Platform: Other
        OS/Version: All
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
          Priority: P5
         Component: spamassassin
        AssignedTo: xrh@spamassassin.apache.org
        ReportedBy: ioir747@hotmail.com


My country changed several names and TLDs. We are in the phase of migrating to 
new approved TLD .rs http://www.iana.org/root-whois/index.html and I want to 
avoid util_rb_tld and util_rb_2tld.
Domains will be available starting this month and WHOIS server also.
Domains will be available for customers directly in .rs for example company.rs 
but for lower price there are several fixed 2nd level 
TLDs: .in.rs .co.rs .edu.rs .org.rs http://www.nic.rs/include/00070.html for 
example company2.co.rs and .ac.rs delegated to academic network and .gov.rs 
delegated to government http://www.nic.rs/include/data/list0029.pdf
These documents will be available in English soon.

Giga

Raghuram Devarakonda <lngjjnbze@gmail.com>,Python-Dev <zvllln-eum@python.org>,"Tue, 05 Aug 2008 19:43:58 -0400",[Python-Dev] os.rename on windows,"Hi,

I have submitted a patch (http://www.python.org/sf/1704547) that
allows os.rename to replace the destination file if it exists, on
windows. As part of discussion in the tracker, Martin suggested that
python-dev should discuss the change.

Currently, os.rename() on windows uses the API MoveFile() which fails
if the destination file exists. The patch replaces this API with
MoveFileEx() and uses the flag MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING which causes
the destination file to be replaced if it exists. However, this change
is subtle and if there is any existing code that depends on current
os.rename behaviour on windows, their code is silently broken with
(any) destination file being overwritten. But the functionality of
replacing is important and I would like to know the best of way of
supporting it. If it is deemed that this change is not good to go in
as-is, how about having an optional parameter to os.rename (say,
win_replace) that can be used by callers to explicitly request
replacing?

I must also point out that the patch uses another flag
MOVEFILE_COPY_ALLOWED effectively allowing renamed files to be on
separate file systems. The renaming in this case is not atomic and I
used this flag only to support current functionality. It is not a bad
idea to disallow such renames which brings it in line with the
behaviour on many unix flavors. This also has the potential to break
code but not silently.

Lastly, I found an old discussion about the same topic by this list.

http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2001-May/014957.html

Even though Guido indicated that he doesn't support API change in this
thread, I am posting again as I did not see any one mention
MoveFileEx() in that thread.

Thanks,
Raghu.

AlxFrag <tizablg@gmail.com>,Postfix users <rljdsng-xyqoh@postfix.org>,"Wed, 06 Aug 2008 01:45:01 +0200",SASL questions,"Hi,

i have a couple of questions regarding sasl.

In main.cf i have:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
smtpd_sasl_local_domain=
smtpd_sasl_path=smtpd

broken_sasl_auth_clients=yes

smtpd_recipient_restrictions=permit_mynetworks,permit_sasl_authenticated,reject_unauth_destination

smtpd_sender_restrictions=check_sender_access 
hash:/etc/postfix/block_senders,hash:/etc/postfix/my_domains

smtpd_sender_login_maps=ldap:/etc/postfix/local_recipients.cf

smtpd_sender_restrictions=reject_authenticated_sender_login_mismatch

smtpd_restriction_classes=verify_login

verify_login=reject_sender_login_mismatch

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
in my_domains:

mydomain1 verify_login
mydomain2 verify_login
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using this configuration user1@mydomain1 cannot pretend he is a 
different user. For example, he cannot send an email saying he is 
user2@mydomain2.

Question1: How can i exclude a user from this rule based on his IP? in 
main.cf i've added: mynetworks=127.0.0.1, his_ip_address but it does not 
work.

Question2: The rule above works fine for all users when they use a 
webmail client or any other client. The only problem is with users who 
use squirrelmail. They still can send emails with a fake ""from address""! 
Postfix cannot stop them.

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance,

Alex

I recently formatted my hp pavillion(s7720.uk) in order to reinstall xp on
it. (Vista was driving me round the bend).
I'm not sure my machine was intended to run anything other than vista. Now
that I've installed xp on it I am missing certain drivers. \\most importantly
\\i cannot connect it to the internet which means I cannot easily search for
drivers.

at present I'm missing drivers for -
Other PCI Bridge Device
PCI Device
SM Bus Controller
Video Controller

What I'm hoping for is that one of you is a hp expert and could help me sort
this out. I'm used to Dell machines so this is proving to be a royal pain in
the $%^ at the moment. To top it off the only other machine in the house is
my italian flatmates spyware ridden piece of shit, wich means saving my own
machine is further complicated.

all help appreciated!

At this point you have probably already swapped the two processes.

I think sa-learn or the process feeding it does not like the chopping.

Don't forget that sa-learn remembers which messages have been learned. Once 
your old messages have all been learned, you need to feed to it only new 
arrivals, that is since the last sa-learn run. No need to keep 180 days worth 
of ham and spam in the temp folder!


Let sa-learn complete and then chop the folder. Just concatenate the process 
rather than schedule it in crontab. It should fix your apparent weirdness.

master.cf; 10026 is the last of three smtpd listeners:

:10026       inet        n   -   n   -    50    smtpd
    -o content_filter=
    -o smtpd_client_restrictions=
    -o smtpd_helo_restrictions=
    -o smtpd_sender_restrictions=
    -o smtpd_error_sleep_time=0
    -o smtpd_recipient_restrictions=permit_mynetworks,reject
    -o receive_override_options=no_unknown_recipient_checks
    -o smtpd_milters=inet:localhost:10004
    -o disable_mime_output_conversion=yes
    -o milter_macro_daemon_name=ORIGINATING
    -o milter_default_action=accept

Default milter_protocol is 3 (6 as advised for PF 2.5 *does* give 
SMFIC_HEADER faults).

milter_macro_daemon_name corresponds to 'MTA ORIGINATING' in 
/etc/dkim-filter.conf - even though people have written that that's not 
necessary any more with current versions of dkim-milter.

Best,

Hi.  Most likely this is a case of overfitting (overtraining):  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting): ""especially in cases where  learning was performed too long or where training examples are rare, the  learner may adjust to very specific random features of the training data,  that have no causal relation to the target function.""  Overfitting in back-propagation neural networks like MLP (resulting in  prediction bias toward one/some of the target classes) can be caused by the  following: if misclassified training instances continue to be misclassified  iteration after iteration, they get overweighted and actually take weight  from the correctly classified instances, i.e. the weights become  imbalanced. Furthermore, if misclassified instances happen to be clearly  concentrated to some classes, this can result in confusion matrix that you  quoted (zero correct instances for some classes).  > I have not found a pattern in the parameters that causes this.  MLP describes the parameters as follows: ""learningRate -- The amount the  weights are updated. momentum -- Momentum applied to the weights during  updating. decay -- This will cause the learning rate to decrease. This will  divide the starting learning rate by the epoch number, to determine what  the current learning rate should be. This may help to stop the network from  diverging from the target output, as well as improve general performance.""  As far as I know, no off-the-shelf formula exists for optimizing these  parameters. It is an interchange of parameters and the dataset. If you are  looking for a pattern in performance, consider that the parameters operate  together (learning rate * momentum / decay) so that the first two operate  for controlling speed of change and the latter for stopping the change.  ""Ultimately, the cost function will depend on the task we wish to perform.""  (wiki). If you are getting as high as > 85% accuracies from most  configurations, this suggests that optimal training model for this dataset  is produced when the parameters are set on 'fast burn' (few iterations) so  I would say higher learning rate * momentum and fast decay work best (do  they?).

Does MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING mean the rename over an existing file is actually
atomic?  I cannot find any MSDN docs that say so (and I've seen some that
suggest to me that it probably isn't).

If it's not atomic, then this doesn't offer any advantage over shutil.move that
I can see (and in fact would damage the usefulness of os.rename, which is
currently atomic on all platforms AFAIK, even though it cannot succeed all the
time).

If MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING miraculously turns out to be atomic, then my
opinion is:

  * this feature would be very useful, and I would like a cross-platform way to
    do this in Python.
  * this feature should not be called ""os.rename"", which for years has done
    something else on some platforms, and so changing it will invite unnecessary
    breakage.  A new function would be better, or perhaps an optional flag.  I
    propose ""os.atomic_rename"".

Also, I assume this cannot replace files that are in use?

I'd be ok with a flag, but it should have a cross-platform name.
""require_atomic"" or ""replace"" or something like that.  I think a new function
makes more sense, though.

I don't quite follow what you're saying here, but I'd be against an operation
called ""rename"" that sometimes was atomic and sometimes wasn't.

Does MoveFileEx solve the atomicity problem that Guido raised in that thread?  I
don't think it does, so I think the situation is still the same.

Linux being based on Unix incorporates the Unix security model.
The Unix security model EXPECTS hostile code to be run on the
system.  The design is for a multi-user system, and even assuming
that all users are both legitimate AND use the system in good
faith, it assumes that not all programmers are perfect, and
that accidents DO in fact happen.

That's what all of the read/write/execute permissions are

The primary threat is the buffer-overflow problem, which was
demonstrated so devastatingly in 1987 by the Morris Worm. We
learned our lessen then about the use of strcat() instead of
strncat(), and other similarly unlimited writes into stack
space (or other memory for that matter).

All of which STILL execute within the chains of R/W/X permissions.
That's WHAT THEY ARE THERE FOR.

You truly don't know what you're talking about.

Go buy AND READ ""The Design of the Unix Operating System""
by Maurice J. Bach.

I paid $80 or so for the 3rd edition in the 1980's.
Used copies of the 4th edition are now available for
the paltry sum of $15 or so.

And as I recall, the virus writer used it to patch the

Your parents are lucky.

In Iraq, we had XP machines on a Department of Defence SECURE
NETWORK which was completely cut off from the rest of the
internet, and they STILL caught viruses.

We need to break the back of the mandatory bundling of Windows.
Personally, I think computers sold retail should be have line-item
costs, with Windows as a separate cost from the hardware.

It's just like payroll taxes deducted out of the paycheck --
what people don't have to explicitly fork over extra money
for, they soon forget (if they were ever aware of it in
the first place).

Even though MSDN docs do not say it explicitly, I found some
discussions claiming that MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING is atomic.
However, after seeing your comment, I did a more thorough search and I
too found some references claiming otherwise. As a last resort, I
checked cygwin documentation which claims that it's rename() is
POSIX.1 compliant. If I am not mistaken, POSIX.1 does require
atomicity so I am curious how rename() is implemented there. I checked
out the sources and I will try to find more about their
implementation.

I completely agree that without positive proof of atomicity, there is
no point in making this code change.

> Also, I assume this cannot replace files that are in use?

A simple test shows that it can indeed replace files that are open.

Thanks,

The cygwin implementation of rename goes like this:

1) Try to use MoveFile
2) Try to use MoveFileEx(..., MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING)
3) Try to unlink destination, then try to use MoveFile

And as you say, Cygwin claims it meets POSIX.1. And, POSIX.1 says, ""If 
newpath already exists it will be atomically replaced (subject to
a few conditions; see ERRORS below), so that there is no point at which 
another process attempting to access newpath will find it missing."" 
Clearly, unliking and then calling MoveFile is not atomic. So, cygwin is 
not being honest here because in these less frequent cases, the rename 
will not be atomic.

Also note, MVCRT only tries step 1 of cygwin's version. Which I believe 
also suggests that it's the only version that is atomic.

Hello,

I am using SpamAssassin in different versions, for example in 3.2.3 an 3.1.7 in
both version the AWL don't work.

Auto White List is enabled in pre and in local.cf. If I send an email to
arignwj@test.de and then send a email back from arignwj@test.de the AWL do nothing.

I try to find a way to say select this mail as harm.
In earlier version of Spamassassin for example in 3.0.3 the AWL worked correctly.

Any ideas?

Thank you

Rather than trying to guess what might be relevant, why not just post 
output of postconf -n as is described in the welcome message you got

  Hi!  Im wondering what advice anyone has regarding this issue:

  When one of our users sends an email with a large amount of local
users listed in the BCC that contains a sizable attachment, it can
sometimes trigger a 'bcc storm'.  

  We have a single F5 load balancer that various services flow through.
A single email transaction can 'loop' through one piece of equipment
multiple times. When one of these 'bcc storms' takes place, because of
this 'looping', it can max out the interfaces to the F5.

  We've taken some measures to prevent this by reducing the number of
different types of services that pass through our load balancer, and
reverted to using RR DNS instead.

  But Im wondering what else can be done.  Taking a look at the q-shape
postfix readme, I see discussion regarding the
'default_destination_concurrency_limit' parameter which sounds
promising, but it affects *all* destinations.

  It there any way to control concurrency limits on a per-host basis?

Thanks. We will get on-board with the latest version and auto updating. FYI, I
also based my bug on the regex found in the WIKI documentation. This rule is
still found there

Exchange Server 2007 mailbox role memory characterization using HP BladeSystem

WHEN:
AVAILABLE ON DEMAND


SPEAKER:
Stuart Ladd, System Engineer, HP Microsoft Solution Alliances


      
      SPONSOR:  
Hewlett-Packard Company


SUMMARY:
With Exchange 2007, Microsoft was able to move away from the limitations of a 32-bit operating system with the move to a 64-bit operating system using Windows Server 2003 x 64 platforms. This allowed for significant increases in available memory resources for the application, allowing memory to scale well beyond the 4GB available to Exchange 2003; designers could now cache greater portions of the Exchange database(s) in memory.
 By increasing database cache, larger portions of the user's mailbox can now be cached, reducing the I/O demands on disk.

This webcast reviews the benefits of the additional system memory in the ProLiant BL480c blade server for Exchange 2007 and details other performance considerations when working with larger memory configurations.

I just wanted to let you know that I used SpamBayes for my term  
project in my Machine Learning class, and to say thanks.  I thought  
there might be some academic interest here, and that I'd share with  
the list in return for the great code of yours that I used.

The overall assignment was to ""do something with evolutionary  
algorithms.""  The goal of my project was more or less to attack a  
spam filter and attempt to use an EA to find weaknesses it might  
have.  I set up a blind watchmaker sort of natural selection/ 
evolution environment using a SpamBayes filter that I had trained on  
an old training corpus as the fitness function.  The program I wrote  
attempted to evolve a generic formula that worked sort of like  
""MadLibs"" to write spam emails that could get past the filter.  I  
started off with almost zero knowledge of how a spam filter works,  
and tried to keep it that way while I wrote the algorithm so that it  
would be as naive as possible.  I've since read up on SpamBayes and  
some of the math behind it, and it looks really interesting.  I'm  
looking forward to taking more time to look through the codebase.

Now that the project is completed, I see where I could have trained  
the filter on different content or parts of the evolution structure  
that I could have written differently to make this project more  
successful, but that's research for you!  This was a very quick proof  
of concept project, and if I were to continue with this research  
there are certainly a lot of things I would do differently and many  
more complicated techniques that I'd like to try.

If anyone is interested in reading about the project in more detail,  
I've posted the paper I wrote here:
http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~egifford/classes/egiffordTermProject.pdf

Thanks again for maintaining this cool project.  I hope you'll take  
my contribution in the intellectual sense that is intended, and not  
as an attack. :)

Liz Gifford

Agreed. I rotate learning mailboxes to historical names monthly.

In other words, everybody has SpamAssassin-SPAM and SpamAssassin-HAM mail 
folders that sa-learn processes nightly, then on the first of the month 
those get moved to somthing like SpamAssassin-x-YYYYMM.

In addition, the script that launches sa-learn only tells it about 
learning folders that have been modified in the last three days.

Indirectly. Use a transport_maps entry to deliver mail through a
non-default mail delivery transport in master.cf, then set a
(transport name)_destination_concurrency_limit for that.

Just clone the ""smtp ... smtp"" line and give it a different
name in the first field, then ""postfix reload"".

The current QSHAPE_README file has examples.

You hit the ""reject"" action because:

- The SMTP client IP address 59.183.54.228 is not in mynetworks

- AND wr.ceatfin.com is not in mydestination, virtual_alias_domains or
virtual_maibox_domains.

- AND the SMTP client is not SASL authenticated.

You can simplify the above access rules as follows:

 smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
          permit_mynetworks,
          permit_sasl_authenticated,
          reject_unauth_destination,

Sometimes mail attachments are truncated and and e-mail is send but files are corrupted.  Mail header contains then: ""X-Amavis-Alert: BAD HEADER MIME error: error: part did not end with expected boundary"". And that is true - there is no boundary for MIME and data stream is not completed. I've turned on detailed postfix debugging and it looks like at some point there is:   smtp_get: EOF instead of:  < some_IP: QUIT  > some_IP: 221 2.0.0 Bye Attachment is truncated after different sizes (sometimes 65kB, sometimes 200kB) and after different times (25s, 100s). The only common thing I've found is that all such mails come from one internet provider that is public-gprs*.centertel.pl I guess it might be the problem with this provider (Orange Poland) but on the other hand they can send e-mails through other mail servers without such a problem. I got stuck with it. Is there any way to debug it more? Do you have any ideas what could be the cause? I use postfix 2.3.8 on Debian Stable + amavis etc. Thanks in advance! Jakub",0,0

It sounds like your issue is that the AWL isn't auto-tracking people that you're

If so, the AWL doesn't do that.

however, such as precisely how miRNAs exert their effects, whether they make
suitable biomarkers, and how they could be applied therapeutically.  Join our
three expert panelists as they discuss current research on miRNAs important in
tumorigenesis, as well as techniques for miRNA discovery and profiling.

In this case it's a single directory yes, but i've generalized it to  
'fix unsafe paths' on VMS.
What would be the proper way to reconstruct the path after the '/'

However, it is possible that before-queue (smtpd_proxy) content filter does not properly handle the aborted transaction and delivers the mail anyway.  In that case, send a bug report to the content filter maintainer. 	Wietse",0,0

"""Dr. Dobb's Report"" <zpw@newsletters.sdmediagroup.com>",user6@gvc.ceas-challenge.cc,"Tue, 05 Aug 2008 18:55:19 -0500",Prizes and Awards: It's That Time of Year,"Dr. Dobb's Update-January 1, 2001







Editor's Note


Prizes and Awards: It's That Time of Year


'Tis the season for prizes, or so it seems anyway. For starters, Edmund M. Clarke, E. Allen Emerson, and Joseph Sifakis received the 2007 Turing Award, the granddaddy of all computing awards, for their work on model checking, an automated technique for finding design errors in complex hardware and software. They share a $250,000 prize.
Moving from computing to mathematics, Pierre Deligne, Phillip Griffiths, and David Mumford are sharing the 2008 Wolf Foundation Prize in Mathematics. Deligne was honored ""for his work on mixed Hodge theory, the Weil conjectures, the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, and for his contributions to arithmetic,"" Griffiths ""for his work on variations of Hodge structures; the theory of periods of abelian integrals; and for his contributions to complex differential geometry,"" and Mumford ""for his work on algebraic surfaces; on geometric invariant theory; and for laying the foundations of the modern algebraic theory of moduli of curves and theta functions."" The three share a $100,000 award.
This year's Crafoord Prize combined the fields of abstract mathematics with astrophysics. Maxim Kontsevich and Edward Witten received the 2008 Crafoord Prize in Mathematics from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, while Rashid Sunyaev received the Crafoord Prize in Astronomy. Kontsevich and Witten were cited ""for their important contributions to mathematics inspired by modern theoretical physics."" Half of the $500,000 prize goes to Kontsevich and Witten, the other half to Sunyaev.
Back in the field of computing, the 2007 Gordon Bell Prize went to a team of scientists--Kyle Caspersen, James Glosli, John Gunnels, David Richards, Robert Rudd, and Frederick Streitz--from Lawrence Livermore National Lab and IBM for a unique simulation of a phenomenon known as Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the BlueGene/L. These gents will divvy up a $10,000 prize.
And finally, there's the Dr. Dobb's Excellence In Programming Award, given this year to....uh, I can't tell you. It is still a secret. But the recipient will be honored in the upcoming April 2008 issue of Dr. Dobb's Journal and in person at the SD West 2008 Conference on Wednesday, March 5, 2008. For a list of previous recipients, visit Dr. Dobb's Hall of Fame. 
Congratulations to one and all for well-deserved honors.

You would need to set your system up to do this for you, possibly parsing logs
or some other MTA-related tool, but it's not a function that SA provides by itself.

However, since this isn't a bug in SpamAssassin, I'm going to close out this
ticket.  If you want to ask for help regarding this on the users@ list, please
feel free to do so.

FROM THE EDITOR


Podcast update: Threats and trends for 2008
[Maggie Wright, Assistant Editor]
rybamlk@techtarget.com

  Per usual, we have several new and interesting audio downloads for you this month, highlighting topics such as malware, network access control and the threat landscape for 2008. 

Malware has been a hot topic in '08. Nugache, sophisticated rootkits and ransomware have all made headlines. Now, after quietly falling off the radar, PDF spam could be making a comeback. Last week, MX Logic, an antispam and managed services vendor, reported that it is tracking PDF spam found in unwanted messages. As part of our Seacurity Wire Weekly podcast series, Sam Masiello, director of threat
 management at MX Logic, offered his opinions on why the format has resurfaced, how security researchers found it and whether an increase in PDF spam is likely. Also, security researchers at Facetime Communications warn of a new do-it-yourself phishing program that assists phishers in attacking social networking sites like MySpace and Facebook.

The network access control (NAC) market was the topic of choice in our Jan. 23rd Security Wire Weekly edition. Dave Bixler, CISO for Siemens IT Solutions and Services, talks about the state of the network access control market, where NAC technology is headed and why he thinks it's smart for organizations to hold off on NAC deployments. 

In our first Security Squad podcast of the New Year, the SearchSecurity.com editors discussed the likelihood of a massive cyberattack in 2008. The team also examines the Sears spyware scandal.  

In last month's Threat Monitor podcast, security threats expert Ed Skoudis unveiled what he thinks will be the biggest security threats in 2008, and offers advice on how corporations can defend against them. Some of the threats mentioned include spear-phishing, botnets and malware email attacks. 

Be sure to check out our brand-new Compliance School podcast, Fact or fiction: Involving end users in the compliance program. Richard E. Mackey, vice president of consultancy SystemExperts, discloses the tools needed to educate end users about the importance of compliance, how users can get involved in the compliance program and why compliance is an essential aspect of corporate risk management.

We're adding new recordings all the time, so remember, you can visit our audio downloads page at any time to listen to all of our security podcasts and subscribe to our podcast feeds.

Have a great weekend!

Notice the ""/2.6x/dist/"" in the URL you quoted. That is the documentation for
versions 2.6.*. We are now up to 3.2.4. I just searched the wiki
(http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/ which is the same as
http://wiki.spamassassin.org/) for links to 2.6x and didn't find it. Is there an
outdated reference there somewhere that I should fix?

time an email is received from the same email address instead of just the

Summary: imap-tte

Initial Comment:
A patch that enables train-to-exhaustion support for IMAP.

This patch has three parts:

1. an __init__.py in the scripts folder that makes some of the classes in sb_imapfilter available to tte.py.  This change is not represented in the patch file; you'll have to add __init__.py yourself.

2. Some imap support in mboxutils.py

3. Some refactoring in sb_imapfilter.py to sink the port selection logic into IMAPSession.__init__ so that it can be used by tte.py.  In the process we simplify the uses of IMAPSession considerably.

This is probably not refactored in the best way; in particular, #1 above should probably never happen and whatever is used by both sb_imapfilter.py and tte.py should be moved into spambayes/ or at least out of scripts/.  However, before taking on any major restructuring I wanted to get this into the hands of a spambayes devel who can make sure I'm on the right track.

I'm a little curious about the -C flag.  The code reads:

         elif opt in (""-c"", ""--cullext""):
             cullext = arg
         elif opt in (""-C"", ""--cullext""):
             cullext = ''
In general it seems you cleaned up my crappy code in tte.py quite a bit. 
Thanks for that...  A couple comments:

* The ""--cullext"" can't work for both -C and -c.  Maybe you should have
""--cull"" (cull with no extension) to avoid conflict?  I made that change. 
Let me know if you have a different change in mind.

* I don't know the sb_imapfilter code at all.  I'll assign this to Tony in
case he has a moment to scan that part of the patch.  Tony, just mark it
closed if you agree with the changes or can easily change anything you take
issue with.

* You're using psycopg classifier?  Brave man. ;-)

Great!  Please give the code a once-over before checking it in.  It
touches quite a few parts of SpamBayes and I don't want to step on any
toes.

I applied it to my environment.  tte.py and my strange
fetchmail/sb_bnfilter.py setup seems to work fine.

    contrib/tte.py 1.18
    spambayes/mboxutils.py 1.11

I would like you to try it out a little, at least, before feeling
confident about it.  I've only used it on IMAP folders and I wouldn't want
to break the other use cases.

Dave,

Do you think this has stabilized well enough to apply to the
repository?  If so, I'll just make a quick review and apply
it.

That patch evolved yet again, massively.  I implemented a version of
culling for IMAP and refactored tte.py to greatly simplify it and remove
redundancy.  Hope you find that nice and not annoying ;-)

It looks like I forgot one thing in sb_imapfilter.py:

@@ -1200,6 +1209,7 @@
             imap_filter = IMAPFilter(classifier, message_db)
 
         httpServer = UserInterfaceServer(options[""html_ui"", ""port""])

I've attached a complete patch that contains that change and all of my
other fixes/workarounds (I have several patches in this tracker that
haven't been acted on).  You can ignore it if you prefer and just make the
additional change above.

The flexibility provided by virtualization introduces several
challenges and places a burden on storage. If your servers are
virtualized, but your storage is still physically attached, you
haven't improved much. 

This white paper explains how virtual SAN storage with automatic load
balancing can provide flexible and fluid virtualization
implementation. Read this white paper to discover: 

** Considerations when selecting virtualization technologies 
** The importance of iSCSI when enabling virtual machines to be on
   a SAN
** A checklist for evaluating a Virtual Server/Virtual Storage 
   solution

I know aliases works but what about but I would really like to forward 
all mail from all users and services, new and old, to automatically 
forward to a central e-mail server which will deliver the account mail 
to its local accounts. I am thinking procmail could be used.

You might look at Options->MailFilters as a work around. We host mailboxes for the clients who have websites with us and we've combined SPAMASSIN and a home grown prefilter which does something similar to the mailfilter function, but in front of spamassin. Has cut down my spam to about 1/6 original volume and mailfilter will move the offensive ones that get by out as well.

from perlretut...

 Non-capturing groupings

       We noted in Part 1 that groupings ""()"" had two distinct
functions: 1) group regexp elements together as a single unit, and 2)
       extract, or capture, substrings that matched the regexp in the
grouping.  Non-capturing groupings, denoted by ""(?:regexp)"", allow
       the regexp to be treated as a single unit, but don't extract
substrings or set matching variables $1, etc.  Both capturing and
       non-capturing groupings are allowed to co-exist in the same
regexp.  Because there is no extraction, non-capturing groupings are
       faster than capturing groupings....

This seems *way* too high. If there have been only 20 messages total in
that folder, sa-learn should have processed these in a few *seconds* or
less.

What did you expect? Based on your numbers above, processing that folder
would have taken 10-20 *hours*...

Hmm. Kmail doesn't start one process per mail by any chance?

Dunno if there are limitations -- however, your 7k messages should be
perfectly fine. Just ran a test on a 6k messages mbox file, and there
was no noticeable difference to a 30 messages test.

On some of my null client systems, I use these main.cf parameters to  
prevent delivery to any local mailbox:

	canonical_maps =
	  hash:/etc/postfix/canonical

	forward_path =
	  ${home}/.forward${recipient_delimiter}${extension},
	  ${home}/.forward,
	  /etc/postfix/forward_all_local_mail

The file /etc/postfix/forward_all_local_mail just contains the string  
""root"".  Human users have their preferred addresses listed in the  
canonical map.  System users, and any human users whose canonical  
address I have forgotten to specify, have their mail forwarded to  
root, whose mail is forwarded off the box via alias or .forward.

(I generally prefer this setup to the one from the  
STANDARD_CONFIGURATION_README as it avoids changing myorigin, so when  
root mail gets to me the header sender and recipient indicate the box  
it came from.)

Thanks, applied _to my svn repo_ :)

I don't have blead commit bits, but I'll present a new tarball for  
testing
once I've applied all your outstanding patches.

Subject: about your music..



Hi, 
We've been checking out music sites and music pages and we want to invite
you to start a free artist page on the fastest growing music site on the
web. This site is simply like no other. 
IACmusic.com is an indie all-star site, it recently got mention in
Rolling Stone, and has been called the online world's most innovative
music portal.  We reach out to bring in artists who are truly creative
with influences vast.  Cashbox found the quality of music on the site so
outstanding that now all content on their Indie Charts comes directly
from IAC.   Our traffic is huge and growing, word of mouth is off the
hook, and our station set-up is years beyond any other music site. 
Meanwhile, our community is thriving with station managers who actively
pounce on the new releases and will help promote your songs for you.
Also, IAC stations will soon be available to listen to via any cellphone
with our recent move into that arena. 
We are about the music and indie culture.   No cookie-cutters were used
in the making of this site.  IAC is colorful and magical, to reflect the
creativity of the artists themselves.  If you choose, you can sell your
downloads, set your own price and you get 100% of the take.  You can
build digital CDs called DMDs which include the revolutionary IAC
Ultrapage.  IAC's dedicated support department is always there to answer
your questions.  Check out the site here.  If you want to find real
listeners, this is the place to do it. 
Here's a direct shortcut to start a free page.  Any additional exposure
will help you get your music to the world. 
Hope to hear your songs at IAC soon! 
Toby, a&r - IACmusic.com

I did, but it was a long time ago. I'll be glad to have
another look at it; I think that code needs more work
before getting mainstream use. But, it is very important,
and not overly difficult.

IIRC, I broke the v0.01 interface, but I will be happy
to discuss any of this, if anyone ever wants to use it.

Perl 5.005 is a great version of Perl and still used by many people.
There have been a few distribution updates and tool changes which mean
that it no longer compiles cleanly everywhere, so I believe it's time
for a second maintenance release of perl5.005, which will lead to
perl5.005_05.

Please compile and make test this snapshot on as many platforms as possible:

  http://perl5005.googlecode.com/files/perl5.005_05-MAINT20070902.tar.gz

This is a release candidate. I'm not interested in fixing warnings.

I'm hosting it over at Google Code, but will push things back to
Perforce when it is done:

It may well be that we  didn't get the wording right yet. First, a confession: most of the major changes in -02 are my doing.  In particular, I think I pushed some things onto Jim that went  further than he had wanted.  I think it's unfair to ask Jim to defend  things that are basically my own responsibility.  I particularly  apologize because I went in for major surgery just about the time  this was hitting the fan, and I'm not yet fully functioning. There's a certain philosophical difference between folks on this  list.  Some want SSP to be extremely specific.  Others have gone on  at length that the SSP spec has no right or authority to impose its  own will on receivers.  I have sympathies for both positions, but I  have to agree that there is no chance that we can successfully  dictate how receivers operate.  I've said publicly many times that  receivers will simply ignore the specs if it makes their lives better  --- as we see today with intentional violations of RFC 2822.  SSP-02  is an attempt to pare SSP down to appeal to the second set.  Yes,  that weakens SSP, but that seems inevitable at this point.  In  particular, I'm concerned that without giving receivers any guidance  on how certain situations should be handled we'll end up in a fairly  chaotic state.  However, I do agree that such guidance should  probably go in a non-standards-track document. A few specific points from your message: --On February 6, 2008 1:46:58 AM -0500 Hector Santos   wrote: [...] > With SSP-02/ASP, we lost the powerful SSP-01 DKIM=ALL protection > against 3rd party fraud. Speaking about SSP-02, I'm not sure how you see we've lost that  ""protection"".  In -01, DKIM=ALL specifically allowed 3PS (Third-Party  Signatures), so arguably it was weaker before.  Under SSP-02, a  receiver could decide that 3PS should be treated more harshly (where  ""more harshly"" doesn't necessarily mean ""discard"" --- it could just  mean do content scanning on the message). We did remove all discussion of 3PS.  The extended list discussion  around them made it clear that we just don't have enough operational  knowledge at this time to understand how they should work.  As such,  we are now leaving all interpretation of 3rd party signatures up to  the receiver.  That doesn't mean we've necessarily lost the ability  to handle 3PS in a distinct way, but it will have to go into another  document, at least for now. > The NEVER concept can still be covered using DKIM=DISCARDABLE and a > NULL DKIM public key. > > The EXCLUSIVE concept can still be covered using DKIM=DISCARDABLE. Except that DISCARDABLE doesn't prohibit 3PS.  It doesn't even say  that messages without any signatures MUST or even SHOULD be  discarded.  All it says is how the purported author domain views the  messages that it sends out.  The furthest it goes is to say that the  purported Author Domain ""encourages the recipient(s) to discard it."" > But anything related to 3rd party signers was completely eliminated > in SSP-02/ASP.  Even though SSP-02 DKIM=ALL is a ""always sign for > 1st party authors"" concept, it is basically a DKIM=DISCARDABLE > without semantics on REJECTION.  DKIM=DISCARDABLE failures is > explicit with the REJECTION control.  DKIM=ALL failures are not. SSP-02 DKIM=ALL is not a ""always sign for 1st party authors"" concept.  It doesn't even mention first parties, any more than it mentions 3rd  parties.  All it says is ""when the message left my control, I had  signed it.""  It says absolutely nothing about how the receiver should  handle the message. Similarly, and as noted above, DKIM=DISCARDABLE makes no normative  assertions about what the receiver should do with the message.  It is  impossible to say anything about when the receiver should reject  messages without stepping into the forbidden territory of forcing a  certain behavior on the receiver. > In short, DKIM=ALL is the SPF version of SOFTFAIL where you can > record it, but you do not take any REJECTION action on it.  Just > like SPF. There's nothing that prevents the recipient from rejecting messages  under a DKIM=ALL condition.  In fact (if we did it as intended) there  is no normative language anywhere in SSP-02 about how the receiver  should process messages, be they signed, unsigned, or 3PS.

I'm not speaking to ASP, but SSP-02 makes (or is intended to make) NO  normative restrictions on when the receiver should accept or reject  any messages. Another addition to SSP-02 was the concept of the Evaluator.  This  was added purely to try to make it clear that SSP is merely one input  into the decision process.  The Evaluator decides whether to reject a  message, quarantine it, do additional content scanning on it, accept  it without further scanning, redirect it to the FBI, post it on  USENET, or anything else it cares to do.  My hope was that creating  an explicit entity that makes the decision and clearly declare it out  of scope we would clarify the limits of SSP. It is my sincere hope that we will quickly gain enough experience  that new documents can be produced providing further guidance (not  requirements) for how the Evaluator should interpret SSP for broadest  interoperability. eric ------------------------------ >From mwbfbfl@santronics.com  Sun Feb 24 10:27:37 2008 Message: 2 Date: Fri, 08 Feb 2008 06:28:05 -0500 From: Hector Santos  Subject: Re: [ietf-dkim] draft-ietf-dkim-ssp-02.txt ASP/SSP section 	2.8 To: Eric Allman  Cc: DKIM List  Message-ID: <47AC3CC5.3000407@santronics.com> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed Eric, I sincerely appreciate your response and I do hope you are on your way  to full recovery from your surgery. I had a hip replacement a few years  back and it was the first time in a long time I was forced into a  prolonged 'vacation' from work. :-) It been a long road to where we are now.  A road where we tuned nearly  every stone and discussed, and even worked out.  There were some  remaining issues, but ones that I don't believe were not addressable. The best I can describe the concerns is that we lost the potential for  protocol consistency fraud. For example, you pointed out SSP-01 DKIM=ALL offered 3rd party  signatures and this could be deemed weaker,  I agree with that point. However, I never indicated that a VALID 3rd party was ever classified as  secured, but the lack of one is were the power of the concept is found. The concept is really nothing new compare to other fraud detection  concepts, things we all do in some form or another, include SMTP. A simple example is a traffic cop requesting and analyzing your driver  license.  The officer is first going to make sure that the attributes  indicated on the card matches what he sees in person. If the driver is a  20 year old woman and the license says 60 year old man, then this among  other thing he can compare raises a red flag. Anything that doesn't conform to expectations is always the first thing  people notice.  As you know, this is a basic model in lots of things we do. In our SMTP world, an excellent example is PORT 25 and its relaxed SMTP  compliance versus PORT 587 and its strict SMTP compliance requirements.    i.e, EHLO checking under port 25 is recognized as low benefit for many  historical reasons.  Under port 587, EHLO correctness is a requirement.    Same with other expects between the two protocols.   In short, PORT  587 has less tolerance towards legacy operations - by design.  You must  login.  You must have certain headers, etc. Even in standard SMTP port 25 operations, we have basic x822 header  requirements that some systems may be very strict about if they don't  exist in the DATA block or post SMTP processing. But there is no BCP for  this. But with DKIM/SSP we can take control of this now and not allow it to  become yet another ""relaxed"" protocol. So again, the power here is in protocol inconsistency fraud detection.  Once things are all ""compliant"" then the other things comes into play,  because there is really not much more DKIM/SSP can do from this point. This is where other layers may come into play, including reputation  ideas and anything else.  I never argued against reputation. I just felt  that one group was trying to based DKIM/SSP on it only and not even  given the SSP concept a chance.  Unfortunately, the entire process has  been commandeered in what appears to be a strategic goal to simply water  it down to a level of total uselessness. So to me the idea of an Evaluator would be first a fundamental protocol  consistency Evaluator that would be part of the DKIM/SSP framework  across all supportive/compliant systems.  It would be 100% independent  from any subjective or heuristics or reputation analysis or any one  group detecting their questionable inherent policies or implementations  methods. It really has nothing to do with good guys vs bad guys because as we  know, bad guys too can exhibit compliant behavior.  But that is we want  here - we want to make sure everyone (bad and good) are all playing in  the same field of following the basic fundamental protocol.  Just like  we expect with other any standard client/server communications protocol. We want this model because if we can't expect compliance with the GOOD,  than we can't expect it from the BAD, and if we allow DKIM/SSP to become  this, we would be back to square one of relaxed SMTP legacy transactions  where receivers lack enforcement and know hows but more importantly has  no new information to rely on beyond the normal level of operations to  consider. DKIM/SSP changes all that, this is what lead me to technology and I of  the belief this will be a major benefit for the SMTP industry. But this is only going to work with a standard protocol ""out of the box""  all must follow if they wish to implement it.  I think this is all  separate from having extra evaluators (i.e, reputations, spam-assassin,  etc).   If we start with standard relaxed higher level system, then we  will have lost an unique opportunity we haven't had in SMTP.

The furthest it goes is to say that the   > purported Author Domain ""encourages the recipient(s) to discard it."" Eric, Agreed.  This changes ""strict"" (the exclusivity) assertion into   something that does not express a domain's intentions on exclusivity.    This assertion simply increases the likelihood of having the domain's   messages discarded. You have previously mentioned the motivation was to accommodate high   profile domains finding themselves victims of phishing attacks.  Using   the term ""discardable"" appears to be sending the wrong message.  It   seems unlikely these high profile domains want their messages silently   discarded, as this assertion implies.  Discarding of messages does   several things: - Destroys evidence of a serious crime - Reduces delivery integrity for important transactional messages - Makes resolving compatibility far more problematic Can you see changing this into terminology that does not attempt to   suggest a verifier action?  Going out on limb, I'll add a modified   furthermore statement.  (Frankly, this furthermore statement seems to   belong in a BCP that happens later.) Using Hector's term ""exclusive""- exclusive: All mail from the domain is signed with an intent to avoid agents that may damage or remove signatures.  Furthermore, in lieu of a trusted third-party signature, if a message arrives without a valid Author Signature due to modification in transit, submission via a path without access to a signing key, or other reason, the domain encourages the recipient(s) to reject the message or issue a DSN when the RFC 2821 MAILFROM domains match. -Doug ------------------------------ >From dupzyp@returnpath.net  Sun Feb 24 10:27:37 2008 Message: 4 Date: Fri, 8 Feb 2008 13:01:14 -0500 From: ""J D Falk""  Subject: RE: [ietf-dkim] draft-ietf-dkim-ssp-02.txt ASP/SSP section 	2.8 To: ""DKIM List""  Message-ID: 	<8k3p2k4495405372skl3204q9f4g5d728klpg0@rpnyex01.rpcorp.local> Content-Type: text/plain;	charset=""us-ascii"" Eric wrote: > It is my sincere hope that we will quickly gain enough experience that > new documents can be produced providing further guidance (not > requirements) for how the Evaluator should interpret SSP for broadest > interoperability. +1 ------------------------------ >From jbtl+fzfg@sendmail.org  Sun Feb 24 10:27:37 2008 Message: 5 Date: Fri, 08 Feb 2008 11:15:15 -0800 From: Eric Allman  Subject: Re: [ietf-dkim] draft-ietf-dkim-ssp-02.txt ASP/SSP section 	2.8 To: Hector Santos  Cc: DKIM List  Message-ID: <52069CA5ADAE4FDE65B4E124@rieux.neophilic.com> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; format=flowed Hector, I have to admit that I'm having a bit of problem understanding  everything you are saying in your response, perhaps because I haven't  been able to get through the nearly 500 messages that came in while I  was recuperating.  I finally concluded that I had to just jump in,  but I am missing some context. Thanks for your example on SMTP vs SUBMIT --- that gives me a good  handle on what you mean by ""relaxed protocol"".  But I'm not  understanding ""protocol consistency fraud"".  I think they are  connected, but I don't understand how, and how SSP-02 makes it easier  vs. SSP-01. So far as I am aware, the SSP-02 /protocol/ is no weaker than in  SSP-01.  What is weaker normative requirements on how the receiver  interprets that protocol, which is inevitable if you buy into the  idea that SSP has no right to impose any requirements on the  receivers.  If you're disagreeing with that premise then I fully  understand; this is just a case where you have to choose one and go  with it, because you can't have it both ways.  As I said before, my  position is that as desirable as it may seem to put requirements on  the receiver in order to guarantee consistent results, the reality is  that the receivers will do whatever they want to in order to give the  best results for themselves and their customers.  Hence, saying ""no  normative requirements for receivers"" is in my mind just bowing to an  inevitable reality. This is at the root of eliminating the concept of 3rd Party  Signatures.  They were only relevant in terms of how the receiver  interprets the DKIM results, and hence inappropriate for discussion. You say some things about the Evaluator that lead me to believe that  you've got a different idea of what it should be than I do.  You say: > So to me the idea of an Evaluator would be first a fundamental > protocol consistency Evaluator that would be part of the DKIM/SSP > framework across all supportive/compliant systems.  It would be > 100% independent from any subjective or heuristics or reputation > analysis or any one group detecting their questionable inherent > policies or implementations methods. This is the inverse of the model in my head, where the Evaluator is  completely /dependent/ on ""subjective or heuristics or reputation  analysis"" --- it is, in short, how the receiver decides how to  process the message.  Indeed, the point of introducing the concept is  an attempt to make explicit what is out of scope for normative  definition in the SSP spec. If I'm misunderstanding what you are trying to say (very possible)  then I apologize and request further explanation. eric --On February 8, 2008 6:28:05 AM -0500 Hector Santos   wrote: > Eric, > > I sincerely appreciate your response and I do hope you are on your > way to full recovery from your surgery.

It's an assertion that the sender would prefer that the recipient not   deliver some small fraction of legitimate email as well as some small   fraction of illegitimate email, rather than delivering those small   fractions of legitimate and illegitimate email. In the senders opinion, it is more important that mail claiming to be   from them not be delivered than for it to be delivered. The english meaning of ""discardable"" matches the semantics pretty   well. If we want implementors to easily understand and deploy the   specification, and more importantly the limits of them doing so, thats   fairly important.

hmm.  This still seems to be a test list, which SURBL don't want to see
used in production, at least going by a mail from Jeff Chan on Aug 18.
we'd better leave it out until he wants to see it in.

ok, marking this bug as FIXED -- all the rules are now dealt with.

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

KI-2004 cordially invites AI researchers and practitioners to meet in
the beautiful town of Ulm on the banks of the Danube in September this
year.

An attractive technical programme has been put together, which covers
a particularly broad spectrum of subfields in AI theory and
practice. It comprises paper and poster presentations, a variety of
specialised workshops and is highlighted by a number of invited talks
from the areas of Automated Reasoning (Jörg Siekmann), Robot Planning
(Malik Ghallab), Constraint Reasoning (François Fages), Machine
Learning (Martin Riedmiller), and Semantic Web (Wolfgang Wahlster).

KI-2004 is co-located with INFORMATIK 2004, the German Conference on
Informatics. KI and INFORMATIK share a joint day of invited
presentations. In addition to the talks by Wolfgang Wahlster and Malik
Ghallab, which are part of this joint programme, various speakers from
academia and industry will give keynotes on their visions in areas
like Ubiquitous Computing, Web Services, and Business Process
Management.

We look forward to an exciting and inspiring conference and to welcome
you in Ulm shortly.

After Super Tuesday's results and yesterday's news that Governor Mitt
Romney dropped out of the presidential race, it's clear that Senator John
McCain will be the Republican nominee.

And while the election is a long way off, he's running neck and neck with
Clinton and Obama in national polls. That's because when people think of
McCain, they think of the media portrayal as a ""maverick""--they don't
think of him as the man who helped George Bush launch the Iraq war.

But a new memo from VoteVets.org shows that when it comes to the war in
Iraq, John McCain has been the president's greatest ally from the
get-go--and most striking is the fact that his plan for Iraq going forward
is the same as Bush's: Stay indefinitely.

Take a moment to read the memo, below--you won't regret it. Then, we're
asking folks to get the word out--can you pledge to pass it on to your
friends and colleagues? The more people that know about McCain's
positions, the better.

Yes, I'll pass this on to my friends.

No, sorry.

I'm also copying the memo below this email, so you can read it here.

Thanks for all you do,

Here's the memo:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Senator John McCain presents himself as a maverick and a critic of the
Iraq war. But a close read of his record indicates that his position on
the Iraq war has consistently matched President George W. Bush's.

Before The War:

McCain used many of the same arguments as Donald Rumsfeld, Vice President
Cheney and President Bush when advocating going to war with Iraq.

  o McCain co-sponsored the Use of Force Authorization that gave President
    George W. Bush the green light--and a blank check--for going to war
    with Iraq. [SJ Res 46, 10/3/02]

  * McCain argued Saddam was ""a threat of the first order."" Senator McCain
    said that a policy of containing Iraq to blunt its weapons of mass
    destruction program is ""unsustainable, ineffective, unworkable and
    dangerous."" McCain: ""I believe Iraq is a threat of the first order,
    and only a change of regime will make Iraq a state that does not
    threaten us and others, and where liberated people assume the rights
    and responsibilities of freedom."" [Speech to the Center for Strategic
    & International Studies, 2/13/03]

  * McCain echoed Bush and Cheney's rationale for going to war. McCain:
    ""It's going to send the message throughout the Middle East that
    democracy can take hold in the Middle East."" [Fox, Hannity & Colmes,
    2/21/03]

  o McCain echoed Bush and Cheney's talking points that the U.S. would
    only be in Iraq for a short time. McCain: ""It's clear that the end is
    very much in sight. ... It won't be long...it'll be a fairly short
    period of time."" [ABC, 4/9/03]

  o McCain said winning the war would be ""easy."" ""I know that as
    successful as I believe we will be, and I believe that the success
    will be fairly easy, we will still lose some American young men or
    women."" [CNN, 9/24/02]

During The War:

Senator McCain praised Donald Rumsfeld as late as May 12, 2004, after the
Abu Ghraib scandal.

  * Asked if Donald Rumsfeld can continue to be an effective secretary of
    defense, McCain: ""Yes, today I do and I believe he's done a fine job.
    He's an honorable man."" [Hannity and Colmes, 5/12/04]

Senator McCain repeatedly supported President Bush on the Iraq War--voting
with him in the Senate, defending his actions and publicly praising his
leadership.

  o McCain maintains the war was a good idea.

At the 2004 Republican National Convention, McCain, focusing on the war in
Iraq, said that while weapons of mass destruction were not found, Saddam
once had them and ""he would have acquired them again."" McCain said the
mission in Iraq ""gave hope to people long oppressed"" and it was
""necessary, achievable and noble."" McCain: ""For his determination to
undertake it, and for his unflagging resolve to see it through to a just
end, President Bush

Senator McCain: ""The war, the invasion was not a mistake. [Meet the Press,
1/6/08]

Asked if the war was a good idea worth the price in blood and treasure,
McCain: ""It was worth getting rid of Saddam Hussein. He had used weapons
of mass destruction, and it's clear that he was hell-bent on acquiring
them."" [Republican Debate, 1/24/08]

  * McCain defended Bush's rationale for war. Asked if he thought the
    president exaggerated the case for war, McCain said, ""I don't think
    so."" [Fox News, 7/31/03]

  * McCain has been President Bush's most ardent Senate supporter on Iraq.
    According to Michael Shank of the Foreign Policy in Focus think tank,
    McCain was at times Bush's ""most solid support in the Senate"" on Iraq.
    [Foreign Policy in Focus, 1/15/08]

  o McCain voted against holding Bush accountable for his actions in the
    war. McCain opposed the creation of an independent commission to
    investigate the development and use of intelligence leading up to the
    war in Iraq. [S. Amdt. 1275 to H.R. 2658, Vote # 284, 7/16/03]

  * McCain praised Bush's leadership on the war. McCain: ""I think the
    president has led with great clarity and I think he's done a great job
    leading the country..."" [MSNBC, Hardball, 4/23/03]

Senator McCain has constantly moved the goal posts of progress for the
war--repeatedly saying it would be over soon.

  * January 2003: ""But the point is that, one, we will win this conflict.
    We will win it easily."" [MSNBC, 1/22/03]

  * March 2003: ""I believe that this conflict is still going to be
    relatively short."" [NBC, Meet the Press, 3/30/03]

  * June 2004: ""The terrorists know that this is a very critical time.""
    [CNN, 6/23/04]

  * December 2005: ""Overall, I think a year from now, we will have a fair
    amount of progress [in Iraq] if we stay the course."" [The Hill,
    12/8/05]

  * November 2006: ""We're either going to lose this thing or win this
    thing within the next several months."" [NBC, Meet the Press, 11/12/06]

Senator McCain opposed efforts to end the overextension of the military
that is having a devastating impact on our troops.

  o McCain voted against requiring mandatory minimum downtime between
    tours of duty for troops serving in Iraq. [S. Amdt.. 2909 to S Amdt.
    2011 to HR 1585, Vote 341, 9/19/07; S Amdt. 2012 to S Amdt. 2011 to HR
    1585, Vote #241, 7/11/07]

  o McCain was one of only 13 senators to vote against adding $430 million
    for inpatient and outpatient care for veterans. [S Amdt. 3642 to HR
    4939, Vote 98, 4/26/06]

  o Senator McCain has consistently opposed any plan to withdraw troops
    from Iraq

     o Senator McCain repeatedly voted against a timetable for withdrawing
       troops from Iraq. [S. Amdt. 3876 to S.Amdt. 3874 to H.R. 2764, Vote

Senator McCain has consistently demonized Americans who want to find a
responsible way to remove troops from Iraq so that we can take the fight
to al Qaeda.

  o McCain: ""I believe to set a date for withdrawal is to set a date for
    surrender."" [Charlotte Observer, 9/16/07]

  o McCain called proponents of a congressional resolution opposing the
    troop surge in Iraq intellectually dishonest. [Associated Press.
    2/4/07]

The Future:

Senator McCain now says he sees no end to the presence of U.S. troops in
Iraq.

  o McCain: ""[M]ake it a hundred"" years in Iraq and ""that would be fine
    with me."" [Derry, New Hampshire Town Hall meeting, 1/3/08]

  o McCain on how long troops may remain in Iraq: ""A thousand years. A
    million years. Ten million years. It depends on the arrangement we
    have with the Iraqi government."" [Associated Press, 1/04/08]

I'd consider it an error.

I think a proto cannot be expected to work retroactively.  In fact, I
think it's probably an error to declare a proto after a non-proto in the
same scope.

I believe ""veto"" is giving the wrong idea here as something that
happens after the fact.  What's the term for only allowing ""acceptable""
candidates to put their names on the ballot?  Anyway, as TSa surmises,
the ballot is vetted or stacked in advance--only those candidates
that *could* bind are considered to be part of the candidate set.
In the abstract, candidates that cannot match never get their names
on the ballot, though of course an implementation might choose to
determine this lazily as long as it preserves the same semantics.

Alternately, even if the list of valid candidates is determined
eagerly, if the candidate list construction is memoized based on the
typeshape of the Capture, it will generally not have to be redone
until you see a different typeshape (where the meaning of ""different""
may depend on how specific the signatures are, and in particular on
whether any of the signatures rely on subset constraints (including
individual values, which are just degenerate subsets)).

***************************************************************************


The capability of reasoning with uncertain and/or incomplete
information is a crucial feature both of human and machine
intelligence. The Special Track on Uncertain Reasoning at the
Eighteenth International Florida Artificial Intelligence Research
Symposium (FLAIRS) Conference seeks to bring together researchers
working on broad issues related to reasoning under uncertainty.  This
track was started in 1996 and has become an annual event at FLAIRS.
In 2003 the track was merged with the Special Track on Imprecise and
Indeterminate Probabilities.

Papers on all aspects of uncertain reasoning and imprecise probabilities
are solicited.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Uncertain reasoning and databases
* Uncertain reasoning formalisms, calculi and methodologies
* Reasoning with probability, possibility, fuzzy logic, belief functions,
  argumentation, rough sets, and probability logics
* Modelling and reasoning using imprecise and indeterminate information,
* using for instance: Choquet capacities, comparative orderings, convex
sets of measures,
  and interval-valued probabilities
* Exact, approximate and qualitative uncertain reasoning
* Nonmonotonic reasoning and belief revision
* Multi-agent uncertain reasoning and decision making
* Decision-theoretic planning and Markov decision process
* Temporal reasoning and uncertainty
* Construction of models from elicitation, data mining and knowledge
discovery
* Uncertain reasoning in information retrieval, filtering, fusion,
diagnosis,
* prediction, and situation assessment
* Practical applications of uncertain reasoning

We are still in the process of finalizing the TREC 2007 Spam Track
guidelines.  This is an interim report.  We should have the final
guidelines by the end of June.  In the meantime, please feel 
free to post queries or comments to this list.

The primary tasks will use the same tool kit and data format as
last year; i.e. the TREC spam filter evaluation toolkit available
here:

    http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/spam/

The active learning task will use a different version of the 
toolkit, to be available shortly.

The three tasks are:

    On-line filtering with immediate feedback.  
        - exactly the same task as for TREC 2005 and 2006

    On-line filtering with delayed/incomplete/noisy feedback.
        - same tools as for the TREC 2006 delayted feedback,
          but the test data may not contain ""train"" commands
          for every message, and some of the ""train"" commands
          may be wrong so as to simulate user underreporting
          and user error.

          Emphasis will be placed on correct classification
          of a large number of messages with no feedback.
          (For example, there may be no feedback for the
          last half of the messages)

    On-line active filtering with active learning.
        - different tools and task from TREC 2006 active learning
          Filters will perform on-line classification as for the
          other two tasks, but will be allowed to query the
          true class (ham or spam) of a fraction of the messages,
          chosen by the filter.  This will be effected by an
          additional command ""query"" added to the toolkit:

               query 

          where  is a message previously classified
          by the filter.   


Filters will be submitted to NIST (date to be determined, but
probably mid-July) after which a public corpus will be released.
Results on the public corpus will also be submitted to NIST
(probably late August).

Improving .NET Application Performance and Reliability with Managed Database Data Connectivity  
            
Many .NET applications fail to meet user requirements because they do not provide optimal access to underlying Oracle, Sybase, or DB2 databases. The root cause is often unmanaged ADO.NET data providers shipped by the database vendor or from Microsoft. In this paper, SQL Server MVP and SSWUG co-founder Stephen Wynkoop explores common misperceptions about data access technologies, describes the optimum architecture for ADO.NET data providers, and highlights key selection criteria for developers.

PRODUCTS AND
PROJECTS
 [01] Paragent 3.0
(upgrade) 
If your upstart is too small to have its own IT administrator, Paragent has
a product for you.  Paragent 3.0 is an open-source, SaaS-based IT
management application that provides real-time, on-demand data and
information about a company's networked computers.  The new release adds
automatic software and inventory collection, advanced search and remote
desktop functionality. Paragent claims to be one of the few SaaS companies
pursuing an open source strategy. http://www.paragent.com
 [02]
Linspire's Custom OS Build Service (new service)
Our friends at Linspire continue to find new niches, the latest being a
custom desktop Linux OS Build Service for its partners. The new
custom-build service is designed to help those partners not only to get the
exact feature sets they want but also cut their time to market and reduce
the expense involved in building a desktop Linux operating system.  One can
build a Debian or Ubuntu-based desktop Linux OS with customizable software
stacks and other features. http://www.linspire.com
 [03]
PostgreSQL 8.3 (update)
The PostgreSQL team is beamingly proud of the new Version 8.3 of the
popular high-performance, object-relational database management system. 
Version 8.3 is said to provide greater consistency of performance than
previous editions, ensuring that every user can depend on the same high
performance demonstrated in recent benchmarks for every transaction. Other
enhancements include over 280 patches, Heap Organized Tuples, spread
checkpoints, background writer autotuning and asynchronous commit option -
all of which accelerate transaction processing throughput between 5-30%. 
Many new features are included for application developers, as well. 
PostgreSQL is available for download from the organization's Web site.http://www.postgresql.org
 [04] Permabit Enterprise Archive
Data Center Series  (new product line)
Heads up storage hounds, Permabit recently released Permabit Enterprise
Archive Data Center Series, a line of scalable data-reduced storage
solutions for enterprise archiving.  Permabit's proposition is that 60-80%
of data in the data center is static and sits on expensive,
transaction-optimized primary storage.  Their solution is to move large
volumes of static data to more cost-effective tiers with the same level of
assurance as primary storage.  The solutions scale up to 3 PB and offer
costs ranging from $0.33 to $2.33 per GB of storage, vs. $25 to 75 per GB
for competing archiving solutions, claims Permabit.  Permabit also says
that its new RAIN-EC data protection technology is 250 times safer than
RAID 6.  http://www.permabit.com

[06] C++ GUI Programming With Qt4, 2nd
Ed. by Jasmin Blanchette & Mark Summerfield
(Prentice-Hall)
Prentice-Hall says that C++ GUI Programming With Qt4 by Jasmin
Blanchette & Mark Summerfield, now in its second edition, is the book
that Trolltech uses to teach Qt to its own hires.  Essentially two
Trolltech insiders have written a start-to-finish guide to getting results
with Qt 4.3 so you can build industrial-strength C++ applications that run
natively on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS X, and embedded Linux without
source code changes.  The book's approach is to use realistic examples and
in-depth advice, illustrating the best Qt programming patterns for nearly
every GUI development task, providing database access, integrating XML,
using subclassing, composition, and more.  http://www.informit.com

Job title: Software Engineer

Company name: AirWave Wireless

Location: United States, CA, San Mateo

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
ok( $you->enjoy_problem_solving() );
ok( $you->strive_for_simplicity() );
ok( $you->write_tests_first() );
ok( $you->want_to_enjoy_your_job() );

Do you pass these tests? If so, you should be writing software at Airwave
Wireless. Our team practices extreme programming (XP), so we spend most of
our time writing code. We believe that running code and short feedback
loops speak louder than excessive documentation and month-long design
meetings. We practice test-driven development and have a comprehensive
suite of tests... over 31,000 at last count. We pair program, so you'll
learn the system quickly and have a great time doing it. We have short
release cycles, which means your talents
won't sit idle working on projects that never see the light of day.
Software you write today will be managing enterprise networks in just a
couple of weeks. We've been cited as the longest running continuous XP
project in the
industry (six years and counting), so we have gotten quite good at
embracing XP's advantages while avoiding its pitfalls.

Personally, I enjoy working at Airwave more than any job I've ever had.  I
am excited to come into work every day, I work hard for eight hours solving
challenging problems, and then go home to lead a well balanced life outside

of work.  When I'm at work I get to interact closely with a group that is
brilliant, funny, motivated, and inspiring.  I spend most of the day
smiling, laughing, and learning.  The team we've built is truly a special
group, and I'm proud and honored to be a part of it.

Excited? Good! Now to the nuts and bolts. Airwave developers write software
in several different languages, primarily object-oriented Perl on Linux
systems. We
use Apache mod_perl2 for our front end UI and PostgreSQL for our back-end
persistence layer. Since we manage network devices, knowledge of network
protocols would be a plus, e.g. SNMP, TFTP, and HTTP.

Rolling out a wireless network is a daunting task, but our products help to
ease that burden. We build network management software that is used by many
of the
leading IT organizations at Fortune 500 companies, major universities,
hospitals, and other prominent institutions. Our industry-leading software
helps plan, configure, manage, and monitor some of the largest wireless
networks on the planet.

Required skills:
 * Perl
 * Object-oriented programming
 * Strong refactoring and design ability

Desired skills:
 * Experience developing automated tests
 * Apache mod_perl
 * Basic SQL (PostgreSQL experience a plus)
 * Experience with agile software development
 * Function or logical programming expeience
 * Linux application development
 * Knowledge of TCP/IP and 802.11 wireless networking

Please provide informations instead of literature. I am happy that 
everything contains the right value for you, but this brings us nowhere. 
so I'll repeat myself.

- print the value of $mailbox (to logs or whatever) so that you see what 
it is.
- ls -la /mnt/gluster/$mailbox/ ... etc
.

and _show_ the results. and while I am in,

Their server identifies itself as ns.ky3.com, but DNS resolves 
ns.ky3.com to 208.183.224.88 which in turn resolves to 
cmscache.clickability.com.

ns.ky3.com has address 208.184.224.88
88.224.184.208.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer cmscache.clickability.com.

If I was in your shoes, I would tell them that the problem is that their 
end, they should fix their DNS entry or the HELO on their server.  The 
moment you ""break"" your server to accommodate people who have configured 
things wrong, you are asking for trouble in ways you may not anticipate.

Tell the client to fix his helo name. ""Spam-Server"" is more than non 
fqdn. it's a provocation!

if you prefer to surrender, then remove reject_non_fqdn_hostname (or 
reject_non_fqdn_helo_hostname).
~~~~~

I can suggest that to him, but this is a client so I can only ask. From the
client's vantage point, our server is the only one rejecting his mail, so I
need to tread politely.

Concerning removing reject_non_fqdn_hostname (or
reject_non_fqdn_helo_hostname) is not something I want to do. If this
weren't a client of ours I wouldn't worry too much about it, but it is and I
must. Is there a way could add an exception to the main.cf for this domain
or IP address?

Again, thank you,

~James

Junior Fellows at the Library of Congress [ http://www.loc.gov/extranet/paodocs/2008jrfellows/pnp-wide.jpg ]Today is one of my favorite days of the year, because it is one of the most compelling versions of ""show and tell"" anyone will ever get to see!

Every year for the past few years, thanks to the generosity of the late Mrs. Jefferson Patterson and the James Madison Council, the Library of Congress's private-sector advisory group, as many as 50 interns have come to the Library through the Junior Fellows program [ http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2008/08-113.html ].

They spend several weeks during the summer combing through both uncataloged copyright deposits and collections acquired through gifts, looking for ""hidden"" gems. And every year they do not fail to impress.

Past finds have included a 1900 blueprint for a proposed expansion of the White House; a 1906 photograph of baseball great Cy Young; a typescript of Cole Porter's 1916 debut Broadway musical, ""See America First""; a 1954 home movie of Marilyn Monroe; and an orchestral score by Jerry Goldsmith for the 1968 film ""Planet of the Apes.""

This year, 200 items were showcased, including Copies of the Virginia and New Jersey Plans (1787) upon which the current bicameral U.S. political system is based; a map of the proposed U.S. Capitol grounds by F.C. De Krafft (1822); selected items from the Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. Collection (1841-1935); the April 21, 1865, issue of the Weekly National Republican, which details Abraham Lincoln's assassination and its aftermath; a rare first-edition piece of instrumental sheet music for the ""Maple Leaf Rag"" by Scott Joplin (1899); a rare print of ""The Rajah's Casket"" (1906) by Pathe Freres, one of the first companies to experiment with the use of hand-coloring in motion pictures; and items pertaining to the 1929 film ""Applause,"" directed by Rouben Mamoulian, along with personal snapshots of the director on holiday with Greta Garbo.

Check out some highlights after the jump.

A clip from a video at the beginning of the display. This Google Earth tour showed the home cities of all of the Junior Fellows, along with some personal information about each. The full tour can be found via Google Earth, here  [ http://www.loc.gov/extranet/paodocs/2008jrfellows/2008-Library-of-Congress-Junior-Fellow-Tour.kml ](link opens in Google Earth).

Junior Fellows found the original copyright renewal application for ""Kinderscenen,"" reputedly the first song written by George Gershwin in 1913 at age 15. The ragtime was adapted from Robert Schumann's ""Traeumerei,"" or ""Reverie.""

And finally, a brief video clip.

During the silent era, earlier films by popular artists were edited together to create new releases. ""The Rounders"" (1914), starring Charlie Chaplin (1889-1977) and Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle (1887-1933), and another unidentified Chaplin film were re-cut, given new title cards, and combined to create ""Greenwich Village."" (""Greenwich Village,"" ca. 1922. 35mm black-and-white safety print from original film. AFI/Roach Collection, Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division, Library of Congress)

smtpd restrictions only apply to mail sent via smtp. if squirrelmail 
uses the sendmail command, then that won't work. and since squirrelmail 
always exectutes as the same user (your webserver uid), there's not much 
to do except finding a way for squirrelmail to implement the restriction.

If he sent e-mail to me, my server would also reject it, then you would 
not be alone.  But seriously, I wonder if setting up /etc/nsswitch.conf 
to check ""files"" first and adding an entry to /etc/hosts would fix it e.g.

64.22.240.195   ns.ky3.com

I am not sure how postfix verifies fqdn, if it uses the OS resolver 
stack or some other method.

Yes. Sorry, I didn't post an update because I was embarrassed at my own
stupidity for not thinking it through more carefully before posting my
original message. Switching the jobs round did indeed mean that sa-learn
is no longer getting interfered with by archivemail while it's in
mid-learn. It now behaves quite sensibly.

Yes I understand that. It's not that I *keep* a temp folder of spam/ham, I
don't. I know that it only needs to learn the *new* mails. It's just that
I'm basically lazy, and it seemed far easier for me simply to take all
my non-spam folders and copy them together into one big temporary
file, run sa-learn on it and then delete the temporary file, eg:

#!/bin/bash
cat ~/mail/mailinglists/* ~/mail/WorkStuff/* ~/mail/Admin/* > TempHam
sa-learn --ham --mbox ~/mail/TempHam
rm ~/mail/TempHam

I'm no bash-scripting wiz (that much should be obvious!) so I could
think of no *easy* way to strip only today's mails out of my 20-odd
folders and just feed those to sa-learn. My way, I need to do nothing
myself, the job takes about half an hour, and I'm asleep when it
happens... OK, sa-learn has to work a bit harder than it needs to, but
hey, better it than me!

The 180 days thing is because I choose to keep only the last 6 months
(approx) mail in each of my 20 or so folders, the rest being zipped into a gzip
archive using ""Archivemail"" (a very neat little utility btw) and 180 days is
its default setting (see I told you I was lazy!).

Thanks for all the help and suggestions. Much appreciated...

Of course you need to find the right words... Be helpful and firm. Tell 
them:
- you will whitelist them (so you're very open)
- but you don't want anyone else to be whitelisted. so they must own the IP
- they must take responsibility for all mail coming out of that IP
- they may have delivery issues elsewhere. they may not realize it, but 
some sites may be discarding their mail. And if that didn't happen yet, 
chances are this will happen in the future. Many people are getting sick 
of supporting zombies because of broken sites.

In short, their system is not configured according to the standards:
- a helo name must be an fqdn hostname (or an IP literal)
- their system must have a correct reverse DNS: IP->name->IP must result 
in the original IP.

It would have been easier if you showed your config. you need to put a 
check_client_access that returns OK but you must not put this in the 
wrong place.

here is an acceptable example:

smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
    ...
    reject_unauth_destination
    reject_non_fqdn_sender
    reject_non_fqdn_recipient
    ...
    reject_invalid_hostname
    check_client_access cidr:/etc/postfix/broken_client
    reject_non_fqdn_hostname
    ...


== broken_client
10.1.2.3/32      OK


In short, you should move your reject_non_fqdn_hostname down enough to 
be able to add the broken_client check before it without affecting other 
checks.

a less appealing alternative is to make your reject_non_fqdn_hostname a 
result of a check_client_access:

==
10.1.2.3/32      DUNNO
0.0.0.0/0          reject_non_fqdn_hostname

but this will only add complexity.

That's not a question for the plugin.  The plugin merely sets the
responder on/off and with a message.  Your mail delivery system does
the actual autoresponding.  You need to know how to configure your
autoresponse system.  If you don't know how to do that, read up on
your mail system and ask in the right forum.  Also note that ""Local
User Autoresponder and Mail Forwarder"" will also work for you, but the
answer to your question will still be the same.

No. don't break your system to try fixing that of someone else. Instead:
- use the opportunity to put ""pressure""
- whitelist his IP

Dear Dr. Meyer

 

Bentham Science Publishers have gained a longstanding international
reputation for their excellent standards and top quality science
publications. Many journals published by Bentham Science Publishers have
received high impact factors in their respective fields. For the current
list of publications, please visit www.bentham.org. Seven Nobel Laureates
have endorsed a number of Bentham Science's journals; please read their
quotes at www.bentham.org/Nobel.htm 

 

The publishers are now undertaking a new publication venture by launching a
number of Open Access journals in 2007, devoted to various disciplines in
the fields of science and technology.  

 

Open Access Journals are freely accessible via the Internet for immediate
worldwide, open access to the full text of articles, serving the best
interests of the scientific community. All interested readers can read,
download and/or print open access articles at no cost. There is no
subscription fee for Open Access journals.  The modest open access
publication costs are usually covered by the author's institution or
research funds. Moreover, authors who publish in our Open Access journals
retain the copyright of their article. Open Access journals are no different
from traditional subscription-based journals; they undergo the same
peer-review process and quality control as any other scholarly journal.

 

The Open Artificial Intelligence Journal is an Open Access online journal,
which publishes research articles, reviews and letters in all areas of
artificial intelligence. Please visit the journal's homepage and
Instructions for Authors for article submission at the following website
www.bentham.org/open/toaij 

 

The journal aims to provide the most complete and reliable source of
information on current developments in the field. The emphasis will be on
publishing quality articles rapidly and making them freely available to the
researchers worldwide. All published articles will be deposited immediately
upon publication in at least one widely and internationally recognized open
access repository. The published open access articles will be indexed by
Google and Google Scholar, thereby assuring their massive international
exposure. Moreover, similar to all open access publications, the articles
will also receive high citations.

 

The journal is essential reading for scientists and researchers who wish to
keep up-to-date with the latest developments in the field. The publishers
are confident of the journal's rapid success. 

 

In this connection, I would like to invite you to submit a research article,
review article or short communication/letter article to The Open Artificial
Intelligence Journal.

 

In case you are interested in submitting an article to this Open Access
journal, please refer to either the journal's Instructions for Authors (the
journal's website is stated above) or alternatively contact us by e-mail at
lbtvp@benthamscience.org or iggccz@benthamscience.org  for submission
guidelines.

 

Thank you in advance for your consideration to submit an article to our Open
Access journal.

 

We look forward to hearing from you soon.

 

With kind regards,        

 

Yours sincerely,

 

Matthew Honan, PhD            

Editorial Director 

Bentham Science Publishers

It is not the client hostname that is rejected, it's the helo name that the 
client itself determines to announces itself to the receiving server.

This is especially stupid since you have to configure the helo of your own system.

So you can only kick the admin of the server with the non-fqdn-helo or 
whitelist the client.

Looks to me like you were running 1.5.2 for a while, then lately, you
upgraded it.  You need to re-run the config/conf.pl utility, and
simply save your settings again.  That will correct the problem.

Don't speculate. Measure. In this case, you need a packet capture to
determine what is sent.

************************************************************************
OVERVIEW

Constraints have emerged as the basis of a representational and
computational paradigm that draws from many disciplines and can be
brought to bear on many problem domains.



************************************************************************
SCOPE

The track is concerned with all aspects of computing with constraints
including algorithms, applications, environments, languages, models,
and systems. Contributions are welcome from any discipline concerned
with constraints, including artificial intelligence, combinatorial
algorithms, computational logic, concurrent computation, databases,
discrete mathematics, operations research, programming languages, and
symbolic computation. We also solicit papers from any domain employing
constraints, including computational linguistics, configuration,
decision support, design, diagnosis, graphics, hardware verification,
molecular biology, planning, qualitative reasoning, real-time systems,
resource allocation, robotics, scheduling, software engineering,
temporal reasoning, vision, visualization, and user interfaces. Papers
that bridge disciplines or combine theory and practice or discuss
novel reasoning methods are especially welcome. A special attention is
focused around the use of constraint technologies in the networking,
wireless and internet fields.


************************************************************************
SUBMISSIONS

We would like to invite authors to submit papers on research on
constraint solving and programming, with particular emphasis on
assessing the current state of the art and identifying future
directions.

Preliminary guidelines:
Submissions should be properly anonymized to facilitate blind
reviewing: papers being submitted should not list the authors,
affiliations or addresses on the first page and authors are also
encouraged to take care throughout the entire document to minimise
references that may reveal the identity of the authors or
institution. The body of each paper should not exceed 4,000
words. Papers failing to comply with length limitations risk immediate
rejection.  At least three reviewers will be assigned to each
submission to the track. Accepted papers are published by ACM in both
printed form and CD-ROM; they are also available on the Web through
the ACM Digital Library. Once accepted, papers must fit within five
(5) two column pages (please check the author kit on the main SAC
website: the format is usually the format used in the ACM templates),
with the option (at additional expense) to add three (3) more pages.
A second set of selected papers, which did not get accepted as full
papers, will be accepted as posters and will be published as extended
2-page abstracts in the symposium proceedings.

Authors of accepted papers must be prepared to sign a copyright
statement and must pay the registration fee and guarantee that their
paper will be presented at the conference.

Paper submissions should be sent (as an attached PDF file) to:

               ayngnxt.ktvtegfzla@iit.cnr.it

The body of the email should include the title of the paper, the
author(s) name(s) and affiliation(s), and the address (including
e-mail, telephone, and fax) to which correspondence should be sent.
The subject of the email should be ""SAC2005 constraint track
submission"" We strongly suggest to use for submission the available
camera ready templates, and adhere to the 5 page limitation.

Registration is required for paper and poster inclusion in the
Conference Proceedings, and for event attendance.

Dear CNET members,


Happy Friday! It's good to be back from a long weekend in Vegas. I had a blast there--not only was the Super Bowl a great game all way to the last minute, but also I was able to do a lot of other things like celebrate a friend's birthday, and a friend's bachelor party, and even got to go see a live Ultimate Fighting Championship match! Talk about a fun filled guy's weekend The only downside, was while my mind helped me feel like I was 21 again, my body said, ""No way buddy!"" So I'm still recovering, but it was well worth it. Now it's back to being a daddy, and husband again. OK, enough about my weekend. Let's get started with Richard's question of how he can remove his hard drive partition.    

This week we received more than 60 submissions to Richard's question in regards to removing his hard drive partition. After reading all the answers, a huge percentage of you recommended a utility called Symantec's Norton Partition Magic to get the job done (second most mentioned was Acronis Disk Director Suite 10.0). While I have never tried any of these utilities, I've always heard good things about them and how simple they are to use. However, these utilities don't come free, and will set you back some money. But if time is money, and the fastest way to get around this issue is to fork out some dough, I would buy it. So to get you started here are a few selected submissions for you to get going. But please, read through the other members' submissions. Some of you may come to realize that it might be worthwhile to wipe your hard drive clean and start over, or just to invest in a new hard drive all together. Before any of you do attempt to go through with this task, I would advise you to backup your data, just in case anything goes wrong. If you have any more questions, ask away. For those of you who have any other recommendations on this week's topic, join in on the discussion. Thank you for your contributions and have a wonderful weekend.






Cheers!Lee KooManager, CNET community

Member Question of the Week


When I originally set up my new computer four years ago, I
mistakenly partitioned the C drive too small.  Now, after
collecting many files, the C drive is more than 90 percent
full, making it difficult to operate.  I would like to remove
the partition and use the entire hard drive as the
C drive, giving 80GB total. The computer has a second hard
drive I use for storage of 250GB. How do I remove the
partition and still keep everything intact? What are my
options? Thanks so much for your help.  I am a retiree
working with genealogy and family history. I'm running
Windows XP. Thank you!

Hi everyone. I bought a Western Digital 200GB external hard
drive 90-plus days ago, and the buttons quit. I can't back 
up. I sent WD several e-mails, and no response from them. If
I get another external hard drive, could I open this one, and
transfer data to the new external one from the old? How would
I do this? Also: If this can be done, could the one I have
then be reformatted, put in a new casing? Does anyone know
how to repair these on/off/auto buttons? Will I lose
everything I backed up to the WD external drive?  Please keep
the explanation simple, as I'm a 63-year-old 'Nanny', IRS
Reg. Tax Preparer. Thank you!

Check out next week's question:


My computer Windows XP Home SP2 computer for 5 years has been getting slower and slower. I know my computer is not infected with spyware or viruses as I run a pretty tight ship when it comes to security. So what's next? I've always heard good things that can result from registry cleaners, but anytime some one mentions registry I cringe at the thought as I've heard that tweaking the Windows registry can easily go wrong and possibly kill my computer. Is this true? How about registry cleaners? Ultimately what can a registry cleaner do for me? Will I benefit from it? Is it safe? I think it time for me to face my fears with the registry. So can you kindly give me some pointers on the ins and outs about registry cleaners,  recommend some good ones that are free or paid, and what should I do to prepare myself for this task to ensure if I do decide to do some registry cleaning that I'm prepared for the worst to happen and recover gracefully. Thank for your advice!

In fact I do, but I have myself somewhat in a sandbox as all the mail handling 
stuff except kmail runs as an unprivileged user, and kmail pulls incoming 
from that mailbox in /var.  I've been doing that for about 2-3 of years, 
started it back at FC2.  And running as root since RH5.1.  Yeah, I'm an 
un-repentant old fart.

A start on allowing plugin configuration.  This revealed a chicken-and-egg

suppose it really belongs in the basic configuration.)  For the time being
fall back to requiring it on the command line.

Millions With Chronic Disease Get Little to No Treatment 
By _REED ABELSON_ 
(http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/reed_abelson/index.html?inline=nyt-per) 
 
Millions of Americans with chronic disease like _diabetes_ 
(http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/diabetes/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier)  
or _high blood pressure_ 
(http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/hypertension/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier)  are not getting adequate 
treatment because they are among the nation’s growing ranks of uninsured.  
That is the central finding of a new study to be published Tuesday in the 
medical journal Annals of Internal Medicine. 
The study, the first detailed look at the health of the uninsured, estimates 
that about one of every three working-age adults without insurance in the 
United States has received a diagnosis of a chronic illness. Many of these people 
are forgoing doctors’ visits or relying on emergency rooms for their medical 
care, the study said.  
The report, based on an analysis of government health surveys of adults ages 
18 to 64 years old, estimated that about 11 million of the 36 million people 
without insurance in 2004 — the latest year of the study — had received a 
chronic-condition diagnosis.  
“These are people who, with modern therapies, can be kept out of trouble,” 
said Dr. Andrew P. Wilper, the study’s lead author. Therapies for someone with 
diabetes and hypertension “are routine and widely available, if you have 
insurance,” said Dr. Wilper, a medical instructor at the _University of Washington_ 
(http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/universit
y_of_washington/index.html?inline=nyt-org)  in Seattle. 
The most recent government estimate of the number of people in this country 
without _health insurance_ 
(http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/health_insurance_and_managed_care/index.html?inline=ny
t-classifier)  is 47 million, which means that if the proportions found in 
the study have remained constant, there might be nearly 16 million people in 
this country with a chronic condition but no insurance to pay for medical care. 
Nearly a quarter of the uninsured with a chronic illness who were surveyed 
said they had not visited a health professional within the last year. About 7 
percent said they typically went to a hospital emergency room for care. 
“A lot of people are suffering from a lack of health insurance,” said Dr. 
Steffie Woolhandler, another of the study’s authors, who is a physician and 
associate professor of medicine at Harvard.  
People with high blood pressure, for example, are at risk for catastrophic 
medical events like a stroke if they are not getting the drugs they need or 
having a doctor monitor their disease, said Karen Davis, the president of the 
Commonwealth Fund. The fund, a foundation in New York that specializes in health 
care research, has done its own research into the lack of adequate medical care 
among the uninsured.  
The study, being published Tuesday, may have underestimated exactly how many 
people who are uninsured have a chronic illness, because it includes only 
those who have already received such a diagnosis, the authors said. Individuals 
who have not had their conditions diagnosed because they are not seeing a doctor 
or nurse are not included. 
The study’s authors say that their findings cast doubt on the common 
assumption that many of the uninsured tend to be young and healthy, requiring little 
in the way of medical care. Because so many actually have chronic conditions 
that may be expensive to treat, the cost of covering the uninsured is often 
underestimated, said Dr. Woolhandler, who advocates a nationalized system of 
health care.  
In Massachusetts, she said, the state’s effort to overhaul its health 
insurance system to cover more residents is costing much more than expected and has 
not led to universal coverage because policy makers assumed that more people 
would be healthy. “The state experiments have all failed because of cost,” she 
said.  
The study describes harsh consequences for neglecting easily treatable 
diseases in so many people. “For some of the 11.4 million uninsured Americans with 
serious chronic conditions, access to care seems to be unobtainable; many may 
face early disability and death as a result,” the study’s authors said.

What link? The spample does not show any. Also, the DNS queries relevant
for SA are those to the various blacklists. By default including URI as
well as IP blacklists.

Anyway, you can't prove the non-existence of a DNS issue, by one
successful query. So we now know that it works at least sometimes. Good,
we pretty much knew that before. ;)

Did you try asking qmail-scanner folks already? That is not the default
SA header.

Because it has been (auto?) learned before?

So?  Hey, I'm not a qmail-scanner guy, that was not meant as a

Now, are you really positive about that, or not?

FWIW, I had an HP dv6000 with hardware problems, and when I made the support 
call I did tell them I was running linux though I resisted any suggestions to 
try Windows and forced them to diagnose it anyways.

When I got my ticket to send it in for service, I pulled the drive altogether 
and placed a sticky on it saying ""HDD removed for corporate policy reasons"".

They fixed my system and sent it back three days later.

If you have a hardware problem, don't bother including the drive.  They can 
troubleshoot it without it, and it keeps them from sending it back 
saying ""WON'T FIX"" because you have linux on it.

Just my 2c...

Cheers,
KV

Gene, how many times have I told you ""don't do that with Linux""? Old fart
or not, you broke it. Now you get to fix it.

You declared you run all mail handling as an unprivileged user. Then you try
to run sa-learn as root on root's mailbox. There is rather a problem there 
if
you think about it. Sit and ruminate a few minutes. Seriously - think.

Have you considered what you are doing and where at least one
hyper-obvious problem lies?

If you're not banging your forehead and screaming ""Doh!"" by now here is the
clue bat. If you've figured it out, ""DUCK!""

SpamAssassin will be using a Bayes database collected as that unprivileged
user. It cannot use one generated as root and placed in root's directory
structure. The last I knew you were trying to use per user Bayes. So
sa-learn as root will build the file in a place the unprivileged process
cannot access AND will likely leave the file with privileges that prevent
access by that unprivileged user.

That's issue one for you to fix.

And if you don't fix your errant ways mama's gonna whup you good.

What size machine are you trying to work on? How deep into your swap
file are you when you run sa-learn?

{^_^}   Joanne, ashamed I've known you all these years, Gene. You shame
        me by not taking advice repeated virtually every time we
        communicate.

Chinese New Year's resolution 
In case you're not following the lunar calendar, Chinese New Year
was yesterday. And for those of you who fell off the wagon with 
your conventional New Year's resolution, the lunar New Year offers 
a clean slate to pick up the pieces of your broken promises and
start anew. This collection of resolution-keeping software should
help you stick to your guns this time.
This week's Top 10 downloads list remains the same, with
Ad-Aware, AVG Anti-Virus, and LimeWire holding strong in the top
three. Antispyware stalwart Spybot climbs three spots to No. 11
to lead this week's Top Movers.
On Crossfade TV this week, the Download Music crew has new tracks 
from up-and-coming London pop artist Kate Nash, electro-pop quintet
Hot Chip, and Cambodian-American indie-rock group Dengue Fever.
Our Game of the Week is the horror adventure sequel ""Penumbra:
Black Plague.""
Happy downloading!

That I wouldn't bet on, but spamassassins kids are running as gene, called 
into service by procmail also running as gene so I'd have to assume the 
applicable bayes database its using is the one in /home/gene.

Good, when you get done I'll buy.

xp-2800, a gig of ram, 2 of swap.  Swap is very rarely touched.

It figures, Joanne would have to see how long she can balance on the soap 
box. ;-)  At least here in Weston, our 'free speech stump', the stump of a 4+ 
foot diameter Grand Old Man that was here & probably 50 feet tall when the 
war between the states was a current event, has a guard rail now, and since 
they left it about 4 feet tall, has a set of steps so even an old fart like 
me can make it up onto it should I feel the urge to make a speech.

However, I see what you are saying, both about perms, and locations.  
Excellent points, I'll see what I can figure out toward making that database 
belong to me instead of root.  Obviously I didn't carry that conversion to 
user near far enough, so I deserve the knuckle rap.

How about I change that kmail filter rule to use:
runcon -l gene sa-learn --spam /path/to/spam
and:
runcon -l gene sa-learn --ham /path/to/ham

Now, I note that the /home/gene/.spamassassin/bayes* stuff is carrying a very 
current time stamp,

Many thanks girl.  I will get it sorted.

Sorry, must have missed this along the way - didn't see any reference to 
Vista, the discussion I thought was all about XP.

A friend is using the Home edition and I haven't ""played"" with it 
(because I didn't want to get tangled up with Home edition :-) ) so 
cannot comment for or against that you have both Admin and user accounts 
on it. All I know is what I heard, and read (and quoted above) about the 
Home edition of XP.

Of course, it is in XP Professional that most people who use it at home 
who never get past the first account - the Administrator - and do not 
create a user with limited access rights.

The need to create a normal, limited access, user in XP Professional is 
not something which is enforced in Professional which is why, I 
understand, most XP Prof. setups are being run by a home user with full 
Admin. rights. I cannot see why the Home edition should be more security 
conscious than the Professional edition, and also cost much less, unless 
SP1 and SP2 introduced the ability to create limited-access users in the 
Home edition.

Ciao.

Load is an issue, yes, but becoming less of one since we started getting some
new mirrors.

Our usage information is outdated - we recommend that groups/companies be
forthcoming with their their users on the topic of how their mail is filtered,
but not a requirement anymore.  I've made a note to fix the pages.

For the record, we've been doing URIBL style lookups against the RHSBL with very
much success for over 2 years now with no negative issues.  I'd go so far to say
that it works better as a URIBL rhsbl then as a From: domain checker.

Both myself and a coworker had the same problem on our new Dell Latitude
D630 laptops. Fresh installs of 10.3. 

We could see an access point but could not connect the majority of the
time. When we were able to connect, signal strength in the Gnome Network
Manager applet would be in the low teens, speed would never be above 24
Mbs and overall performance would be extremely poor. 

After much troubleshoot I discovered that during installation both the
ipw3945 and the iwl3945 kernel modules got installed. Yast chose the
ipw3945 module when setting up the wireless.  From some of the messages
I've seen when Googleing Intel 3945, there seem to be some significant
issues with the ipw3945 kernel driver.  

The fix is to in YAST, select Configure on the Wireless Card. Select the
Hardware Tab, then change the Kernel Module in the Module Name Drop down
list from the ipw3945 to the iwl3945.  Save the settings and exit out of
YAST.  Reboot the laptop.  

If the iwl3945 kernel module is not in the list install it first then
reboot and change.

According to the chatter, some of the features of the iwl3945 module are
done yet. Like illuminating the blue Wifi light and displaying the
connection speed in the Network manager. But other than those cosmetic
issues, it is reliable and works every time I boot.  I have no trouble
going between the office wireless and my home wireless, or using any
other wifi connection I have tried. 

Give it shot and let us know how it works.

Summary: imap-tte

Initial Comment:
A patch that enables train-to-exhaustion support for IMAP.

This patch has three parts:

1. an __init__.py in the scripts folder that makes some of the classes in sb_imapfilter available to tte.py.  This change is not represented in the patch file; you'll have to add __init__.py yourself.

2. Some imap support in mboxutils.py

3. Some refactoring in sb_imapfilter.py to sink the port selection logic into IMAPSession.__init__ so that it can be used by tte.py.  In the process we simplify the uses of IMAPSession considerably.

This is probably not refactored in the best way; in particular, #1 above should probably never happen and whatever is used by both sb_imapfilter.py and tte.py should be moved into spambayes/ or at least out of scripts/.  However, before taking on any major restructuring I wanted to get this into the hands of a spambayes devel who can make sure I'm on the right track.

I'm a little curious about the -C flag.  The code reads:

         elif opt in (""-c"", ""--cullext""):
             cullext = arg
         elif opt in (""-C"", ""--cullext""):
             cullext = ''
In general it seems you cleaned up my crappy code in tte.py quite a bit. 
Thanks for that...  A couple comments:

* The ""--cullext"" can't work for both -C and -c.  Maybe you should have
""--cull"" (cull with no extension) to avoid conflict?  I made that change. 
Let me know if you have a different change in mind.

* I don't know the sb_imapfilter code at all.  I'll assign this to Tony in
case he has a moment to scan that part of the patch.  Tony, just mark it
closed if you agree with the changes or can easily change anything you take
issue with.

* You're using psycopg classifier?  Brave man. ;-)

Great!  Please give the code a once-over before checking it in.  It
touches quite a few parts of SpamBayes and I don't want to step on any
toes.

I would like you to try it out a little, at least, before feeling
confident about it.  I've only used it on IMAP folders and I wouldn't want
to break the other use cases.

Dave,

Do you think this has stabilized well enough to apply to the
repository?  If so, I'll just make a quick review and apply
it.

That patch evolved yet again, massively.  I implemented a version of
culling for IMAP and refactored tte.py to greatly simplify it and remove
redundancy.  Hope you find that nice and not annoying ;-)

Nowhere have I said anything about not being able to create new users.

All the above quote is stating is, ""....bestows Administrative rights on 
*anyone* [my emphasis] who logs into the computer,...."".

What you write is, of course, all very exciting - except that for the 
Joe-in-the-street who buys a copy of the Home edition (AND Professional, 
BTW) will not have a damn clue that you need to use the OS as a user 
with NO Administrator privileges.

Which is why openSUSE was created.

Put on an average gain of 3.02 inches where it matters - and all gains are 100% permanent!

Summary: imap-tte

Initial Comment:
A patch that enables train-to-exhaustion support for IMAP.

This patch has three parts:

1. an __init__.py in the scripts folder that makes some of the classes in sb_imapfilter available to tte.py.  This change is not represented in the patch file; you'll have to add __init__.py yourself.

2. Some imap support in mboxutils.py

3. Some refactoring in sb_imapfilter.py to sink the port selection logic into IMAPSession.__init__ so that it can be used by tte.py.  In the process we simplify the uses of IMAPSession considerably.

This is probably not refactored in the best way; in particular, #1 above should probably never happen and whatever is used by both sb_imapfilter.py and tte.py should be moved into spambayes/ or at least out of scripts/.  However, before taking on any major restructuring I wanted to get this into the hands of a spambayes devel who can make sure I'm on the right track.

On --cullext vs --cull, I was thinking it could be '--cullext=' but if
getopt doesn't like that, I'm fine with --cull.

Since tony isn't very active, the thing got auto-closed.  But shouldn't
the patch be applied if he's not going to look at it?

I'm a little curious about the -C flag.  The code reads:

         elif opt in (""-c"", ""--cullext""):
             cullext = arg
         elif opt in (""-C"", ""--cullext""):
             cullext = ''
In general it seems you cleaned up my crappy code in tte.py quite a bit. 
Thanks for that...  A couple comments:

* The ""--cullext"" can't work for both -C and -c.  Maybe you should have
""--cull"" (cull with no extension) to avoid conflict?  I made that change. 
Let me know if you have a different change in mind.

* I don't know the sb_imapfilter code at all.  I'll assign this to Tony in
case he has a moment to scan that part of the patch.  Tony, just mark it
closed if you agree with the changes or can easily change anything you take
issue with.

* You're using psycopg classifier?  Brave man. ;-)

Great!  Please give the code a once-over before checking it in.  It
touches quite a few parts of SpamBayes and I don't want to step on any

I would like you to try it out a little, at least, before feeling
confident about it.  I've only used it on IMAP folders and I wouldn't want
to break the other use cases.

Dave,

Do you think this has stabilized well enough to apply to the
repository?  If so, I'll just make a quick review and apply
it.

That patch evolved yet again, massively.  I implemented a version of
culling for IMAP and refactored tte.py to greatly simplify it and remove
redundancy.  Hope you find that nice and not annoying ;-)

thanks for your effort!

To compile on recent Gentoo systems, ext/IPC/SysV/SysV.xs needs
some tweakage. In blead, this was fixed by change #31702. However,
this doesn't work for 5.005, as HAS_GETPAGESIZE and HAS_SYSCONF
are not determined by Configure.

I'm pretty confident that the  include isn't needed
on Linux. I've been testing this with a vanilla RedHat installs
back to RH 5.2 (Linux 2.0.36 #1 Tue Oct 13 22:17:11 EDT 1998),
and they work fine without the header. But there may be be some
platform dependency, so I think a safe approach would be to
remove the include for x86-Linux only. Here's a patch:

With this, all tests pass on all my Linux systems.

There is a setting somewhere, I don't know where, but it is about 300 
secs or 5 mins. of inactivity. If I'm going away for a moment or two, 
just start tailf /var/log/mail (if a mail server) or tailf 
/var/log/messages if you have some syslog activity and that will hold 
the connection until you get back;

Another, ""more proper"" way to do it is to use ""screen"", the detach the 
session, leave it running, and then reattach when necessary. Note, this 
doesn't save a lot of keystrokes, but if you have a process on a remote 
system you need to leave running, either screen or backgrounding the 
process makes the most sense. See man screen (basically just type screen 
in any terminal, then ctrl-a h and choose detach or ctrl-a d.

Good catch Brad. I'm still stuck in the 32bit world, so I didn't even

Many thanks, David, for the above.

File::Spec->catdir will put the path back together.

The '/' trick only works if the string is a directory name with UNIX 
style directory delimiters or no directory delimiters.  It is to force 
vmsify to treat the input specification as UNIX.

There is a VMS::Filespec::unixpath() to do the appending of the '/' to 
the specification, which will do a VMS::Filespec::vmsify() if needed.

However it is not a good idea to call vmsify() on a pathname returned by 
unixify(), and it is not a good idea to call unixify() on a pathname 
returned by vmsify().  Because of the nature of the conversion, not all 
file specifications can make the round trip.

I think that directory specifications can safely make the round trip, 
but not ones containing filenames.

Summary: imap-tte

Initial Comment:
A patch that enables train-to-exhaustion support for IMAP.

This patch has three parts:

1. an __init__.py in the scripts folder that makes some of the classes in sb_imapfilter available to tte.py.  This change is not represented in the patch file; you'll have to add __init__.py yourself.

2. Some imap support in mboxutils.py

3. Some refactoring in sb_imapfilter.py to sink the port selection logic into IMAPSession.__init__ so that it can be used by tte.py.  In the process we simplify the uses of IMAPSession considerably.

This is probably not refactored in the best way; in particular, #1 above should probably never happen and whatever is used by both sb_imapfilter.py and tte.py should be moved into spambayes/ or at least out of scripts/.  However, before taking on any major restructuring I wanted to get this into the hands of a spambayes devel who can make sure I'm on the right track.

On --cullext vs --cull, I was thinking it could be '--cullext=' but if
getopt doesn't like that, I'm fine with --cull.

Since tony isn't very active, the thing got auto-closed.  But shouldn't
the patch be applied if he's not going to look at it?

I'm a little curious about the -C flag.  The code reads:

         elif opt in (""-c"", ""--cullext""):
             cullext = arg
         elif opt in (""-C"", ""--cullext""):
             cullext = ''
In general it seems you cleaned up my crappy code in tte.py quite a bit. 
Thanks for that...  A couple comments:

* The ""--cullext"" can't work for both -C and -c.  Maybe you should have
""--cull"" (cull with no extension) to avoid conflict?  I made that change. 
Let me know if you have a different change in mind.

* I don't know the sb_imapfilter code at all.  I'll assign this to Tony in
case he has a moment to scan that part of the patch.  Tony, just mark it
closed if you agree with the changes or can easily change anything you take
issue with.

* You're using psycopg classifier?  Brave man. ;-)

Great!  Please give the code a once-over before checking it in.  It
touches quite a few parts of SpamBayes and I don't want to step on any

I would like you to try it out a little, at least, before feeling
confident about it.  I've only used it on IMAP folders and I wouldn't want
to break the other use cases.

Dave,

Do you think this has stabilized well enough to apply to the
repository?  If so, I'll just make a quick review and apply
it.

That patch evolved yet again, massively.  I implemented a version of
culling for IMAP and refactored tte.py to greatly simplify it and remove
redundancy.  Hope you find that nice and not annoying ;-)

Back to business
    Let's face it. Few people like going to work, but most of us have to do it. Thanks to the Web and lots and lots of microchips, we can work from almost anywhere these days. But it can still be tedious and unproductive without the right tools. This month's Living With Technology gives you productivity tips and shows you the best tools to use, plus we look at how Web sites may be affecting boxed software giants like Microsoft.

I know, that was the reason to let Vahe first try it the easy way. BTW, 
there is a bug report about the ""missing"" documentation of the rescue

Increase both your thickness and length within a few short weeks - women simply love it when you have a large manhood.

I'm slowly working on moving suspend2.net/tuxonice.net to a new server based on Slicehost. (We've been abusing the kindness of the UWA computer club for too long). I've completed moving the wiki to the new server earlier in the afternoon - all going well, you shouldn't notice a difference yet. I'm looking to make some changes, though, to reduce issues with spam. At the moment I have some lines commented out that will limit editing so that a secure http connection is required. The other possibility is using captcha. I wouldn't mind any feedback people would like to give. In an hour or two, I plan on shifting email to the new server. This means that lists in particular will be down for at least part of the evening (Australian Eastern Standard Time). In the process, I'm going to rename the suspend2-* lists to tuxonice-*.

After you get the interface defined, I think that it should either 
become part of VMS.c or statically linked with it.

VMS.C is currently looking up and caching the values of several logical 
names.  If those logical names are changed through VMS::LOGICAL then it 
may be desirable to update the value inside of VMS.C to match.

Special care is needed with the logical names that control C features, 
as it is an alternate method of controlling behavior.

We need to find out what happens if you create a logical name to change 
a feature to be different than what it was specifically set to using the 
decc$feature_*() api, and behave the same way in VMS.C

I may need this to make the ODS-5 handling work on older versions of VMS.

To: TuxOnIce-users  Message-ID: <47AD8023.5010905@nigel.suspend2.net> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=""iso-8859-1"" Hi all. Here are test patches which should be of interest to this who've been having problems with the I/O speed. I'm providing patches for 2.6.23.15 and 2.6.24.1. The whole lowlevel I/O code has had quite a rework. In /sys/power/tuxonice/block_io, the only remaining entry is target_outstanding_io, which can be used to say how much memory you'd like to have made available for I/O. If more is available, it will be used too. There's one new entry in the /sys/power/tuxonice directory - no_flusher_thread. This entry is only useful if you've got multiple cpus/cores, and then only if no_multithreaded_io is 0 (ie multithreaded I/O is enabled). What I've done is this: by default, we now dedicate one thread (the CPU 0 one) to just submitting I/O. All other threads spend their time compressing pages and filling pages with the compressed data and associated metadata, then queueing filled pages for the submission thread to handle. If there's only one thread or no_flusher_thread is used, we go back to the old behaviour - threads compress, fill pages and submit them. So... options for multicore users: 1) Single threaded operation procsetting no_multithreaded_io 1 2) Multithreaded, flusher thread (default) procsetting no_multithreaded_io 0 procsetting no_flusher_thread 0 3) Multithreaded, no flusher thread procsetting no_multithreaded_io 0 procsetting no_flusher_thread 1 If you give the patches a try, would you please let me know how these different options perform?

I have not attached this file because I am still somewhat used to the
good old days, when attaching big files was a big NONO unless explicitly
requested :-)

I'll try this (can't do that right now because the box is in the office)
and report back with Xorg.0.log if it don't help.

Thanks for this diagnosis.. in this case, the fix is actually simple:

Instead of doing the lookup straight in the module tree, we search  
for a pattern
with qr/$mod/i and it will find it that way -- this means it needs to  
spend a few
more CPU cycles getting the right answer, but the patch becomes easy:

                      push @rv, $modobj;

I've applied this patch to the development version of CPANPLUS.

The capability of reasoning with uncertain and/or incomplete
information is a crucial feature both of human and machine
intelligence. The Special Track on Uncertain Reasoning at the
Eighteenth International Florida Artificial Intelligence Research
Symposium (FLAIRS) Conference seeks to bring together researchers
working on broad issues related to reasoning under uncertainty. This
track was started in 1996 and has become an annual event at FLAIRS. In
2003 the track was merged with the Special Track on Imprecise and
Indeterminate Probabilities.

Papers on all aspects of uncertain reasoning and imprecise
probabilities are solicited.  Topics of interest include, but are not
limited to:

* Uncertain reasoning and databases 
* Uncertain reasoning formalisms, calculi and methodologies 
* Reasoning with probability, possibility, fuzzy logic, belief functions, 
  argumentation, rough sets, and probability logics 
* Modelling and reasoning using imprecise and indeterminate information, 
* using for instance: Choquet capacities, comparative orderings, convex 
sets of measures, 
  and interval-valued probabilities 
* Exact, approximate and qualitative uncertain reasoning 
* Nonmonotonic reasoning and belief revision 
* Multi-agent uncertain reasoning and decision making 
* Decision-theoretic planning and Markov decision process 
* Temporal reasoning and uncertainty 
* Construction of models from elicitation, data mining and knowledge 
discovery 
* Uncertain reasoning in information retrieval, filtering, fusion, 
diagnosis, 
  prediction, and situation assessment 
* Practical applications of uncertain reasoning

Ouch, that would hurt my arthritic joints something terrible. Can it wait till 
I've had a chance to hit my thumbs with another cortisone shot?  On second 
thought, the iron bar is less painful in the short term.  The last time I 
checked, they wanted to do surgery at $5k per thumb and I said how about 
cortisone?  He said then (15 years ago) that it was $60 a shot, and it would 
hurt like hell.  He was right on both counts, but that thumb still works 
today.  Now its the other ones turn I guess.  :)

Last time you've asked me about Canadian pharmacy shops.

After some researches I can surely say that MyCanadianPharmacy

drug store sells high-quality medications only. There is no need to be

aware of quality. Their medications are the same we have here in USA.

But they give us opportunity to buy these meds at lower prices.

VISIT THIS LINK  

I recommend to buy medications at their drug store!

I've installed the chipset software from Nvidia for my motherboard hoping
that this would fix the issue.
I've installed realtek drivers to specifically try fix the networking issue.
Once they install I see no change on my device management setup. no new
network cards listed, just the standard ieee1394 controller.

My Other Pci Bridge Device and SM Bus Controller are still being listed as
other devices..

I'm going round in circles here and am at odds with reinstalling vista just
because I can't find the right driver.

Vista is pretty, but clunky and a resource eating beast. I've already forked
out on extra RAM and at 2gb I've hit capacity for my machine. (Thats not
including the capacity I've added through ready boost)

I want XP (I never thought I'd hear myself say that)!

plus this stupid fucking italian keyboard is making everything all the more
infuriating...whats the point in me meditating when technology is lurking
round every corne to thwart my good will.


cheers,

Richard

The Japanese eat very little fat and suffer fewer heart attacks than the
British or the Americans.

On the other hand, the French eat a lot of fat and also suffer fewer heart
attacks than the British or the Americans.

The Japanese drink very little red wine and suffer fewer heart attacks than
the British or the Americans.

The Italians drink excessive amounts of red wine and also suffer fewer heart
attacks than the British or the Americans.

Conclusion: Eat and drink whatever you like. It's speaking English that
kills you.

Why does it still miss test_harness :)

Anyway
Builds fine on HP-UX 10.20 PA-RISC
All tests successful.
u=0.62  s=0.28  cu=18.01  cs=1.67  scripts=185  tests=14327

make: *** [lib/auto/ODBM_File/ODBM_File.sl] Error 2

This is because the -Duse64bitall did not correctly propagate to the ccflags,
so you end up with

% file perl
perl:           ELF-32 executable object file - IA64

It would require to change the ccflags from -Aa to -Ae +DD64, but then I
also need to change the lib search path etc etc
Just because I could not resist the first two steps ...

I've tried upgrading some dual-life modules and several fail, mostly because
some of the very basic modules fail, like PathTools:

Er.. So I have a rail of ""ok"" but Test::More still thinks there's a
failing test.


OTOH, the same failures occur with 5.5.3 so at least they weren't
introduced by 5.5.5

I believe both versions work the same.  The first account has admin
rights and many people don't go beyond that to create users with
restricted rights.  They simply don't realize the difference between
admin and user.  At least in Linux, at least SUSE, you get warnings
about running as root and you're expected to create a user during
install.  With Ubuntu and some other distros, the first user is an admin
user, with rights to create a root password.  Additional users are mere
mortals.

*
Current Committee Vacancies - Get on board!!*

There are currently a few positions available. If you are interested, 
please contact Anneka Vuletich 421-0919 in the first instance.

*_President_* (Approximately three hours per month)
This involves setting the agenda for the monthly meetings and
running them, writing the president's blurb that appears in the
newsletter each month, and general support of committee.

_*Vice President*_
VP is currently unfilled. It is a support role to President and would
include assisting with committee meetings and upcoming events.
It would probably average about two hours per month.

*_Antenatal Packs_ *(three hours per month)
Ordering and photocopying pamphlets as required. You are required to 
make up two packs per couple for each antenatal course and you need the 
space to store two large containers.

_*Antenatal Leader*_
Remember your antenatal class? The person who set up and helped “glue” 
the class together? Want to emulate her? This is a paid position if one 
person will do all the classes to provide consistency. There is 
currently a total of seven per year. Otherwise, if you’re thinking of 
adding to your family or just want an antenatal update – volunteer as a 
Leader for one course (seven Wednesday nights).

*_Newsletter Editor_ *(five hours plus every second month_)_
Collate material for this newsletter from other committee members and 
own topics. All advertising is supplied by the advertising co-ordinator. 
The newsletter is currently formatted in Microsoft Publisher.

_*Baby & You Course Convener*_

There are six Baby and You courses booked for 2008. This is a very 
critical role as Baby and You forms part of the core course that HBC 
Parents Centre promotes.
It may be possible for two people to run this course.
The tasks include:
Set up in week one and pack down in week five
Booking venue – Whangaparaoa library
Confirming speakers
Making sure that speakers are paid on time
A Saturday CPR course - one per course
Reviewing course evaluations
Making sure that accurate statistics are kept
Organising hosts to assist in the following Baby and You course

Compilation and tests ok on WinXP/MSVC6 and RedHat9/gcc.
Installation of new version of Data::Dumper failed (tried only on
RedHat - it is hard to try anything on Windows with this version).

I pounded my head against this issue when working on a .bat file a few
years back, until I read the help for cmd and saw the quote logic (and
switched to VBScript).  It's still there, in ""help cmd"".  I had once found
references to the same issue for the run command in Microsoft's online help.

Perhaps it is fixed in SP2. If so, just change it and don't worry about
users with earlier versions of Windows.

a h   ????

	My head is officially melted - situations like this make me hate
not only computers but the fuckers who work with them, every person who
uses them sucessfully and pretty much anyone else on the planet. aaargh
	
	here is my machine specs:

n&dlc=en&product=3357149&dlc=en⟨=en
   
	
	I've installed the chipset software from Nvidia for my
motherboard hoping that this would fix the issue. 
	I've installed realtek drivers to specifically try fix the
networking issue. Once they install I see no change on my device
management setup. no new network cards listed, just the standard
ieee1394 controller. 
	
	My Other Pci Bridge Device and SM Bus Controller are still being
listed as other devices..
	
	I'm going round in circles here and am at odds with reinstalling
vista just because I can't find the right driver. 
	
	Vista is pretty, but clunky and a resource eating beast. I've
already forked out on extra RAM and at 2gb I've hit capacity for my
machine. (Thats not including the capacity I've added through ready
boost) 
	
	I want XP (I never thought I'd hear myself say that)!
	
	plus this stupid fucking italian keyboard is making everything
all the more infuriating...whats the point in me meditating when
technology is lurking round every corne to thwart my good will. 
	
	
	cheers,
	
	Richard
	
	* I officially hate HP, realtek, Windows and every other fucking
site I've been to today that has failed to help me resolve this
issue.

Thank you for this post.  My previous experience with virtualization
software has been frustrating, to say the list.  Following your
instructions, the software installed without any problemd.

As a new user, I tired to configure too many options at once.  The only
initial configuration required was mounting the dvd drive and selecting
ALSA as the sound device.

To access my home directory and the printer, I had to do a network
setup.  Is this the the best way or are there better alternatives?

As regards the network cards, sound cards and other such equipment, is
it possible to have direct access in vbox or does this cause problems
with the host system?

Here I go. I'm writing this notes as I go, but I'll post when I finish.


1) It is designed for an older set of libraries.

Gtk-WARNING **: Failed to load module ""libgnomebreakpad.so"": libgnomebreakpad.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

But it does exist, in ""/usr/lib/gtk-2.0/modules/libgnomebreakpad.so"". I 
guess it is looking for an older version.


2) It does not support UTF8

It displays latin1, and when I type an accented letter it displays two 
strange letters - so no utf. I had to start an xterm in latin1:

   LANG=en_US.ISO-8859-1 LC_ALL=en_US.ISO-8859-1 /usr/bin/xterm -bd blue &

and from there I fire up manedit.

This could be the worst problem of all, because there is no way to edit in 
utf8 with manedit. Do you know if current man pages are supposed to be UTF 
or latin1?

[see later]

3) It is an XML editor, which it translates to troff when saving; and it 
is not WYSIWYG - but that is what you said in your write up. I'd like it 
to have a toggle to show the formatted output, but no.


4) It warns that if I enable syntax highlighting, it may crash. So far it 
hasn't, but who knows...

5) I can not even change the font size: the letters get substituted by 
squares, or I loose accents. I had to delete the configuration file to 
restore working defaults. It must be a byproduct of not supporting utf.


[...]

I haven't finished yet, but I found a blocker.

The program does it job fairly well, but the locale encoding turns out to 
be a problem.

I asked the people of the project for whom I'm translating their 
pages, whether they wanted the pages in latin1 or utf8, and the answer is 
""neither"":

]  Characters outside the ASCII printable range must be encoded; see
]  groff_char(7) (but note that we use ""\\('e"" rather than ""\\['e]"").


This is a problem too with manual pages in the suse distro: they either 
display well in latin 1 or in utf 8, but not both. And using the encoding 
described in groff_char(7) they display correctly in both. The blocker is 
that manedit does not support that encoding.

I would have to write ""ol\\('e"" instead of ""olé"", which may be just 
a nuisance for a coder, but it is a big inconvenience for a writer: I can 
not spell check the file, and my sight doesn't see ""olé"" but gibberish, so 
I can't proofread the text.

:-/

I don't understand how nobody has created a good program for writing 
documentation ""man"" files by mere mortals, not by coders. And I do 
understand now why some projects refuse altogether to create a man page 
and make do instead with html or pdf files, or why man page translations 
are so obsolete as to be useless, when they do exist.


I have also discarded (and some tried) gmanedit, gconglomerate, gjots2, 
pandoc, zoem...

I don't know what I will do. :-/

No.

The problem is, that if you enable such access, your VM (virtual
machine) will no longer be isolated, so the code will leak, and it may
destroy data on your host (physical PC).
This is very unsafe.

Hans Witvliet <yovr@a-domani.nl>,wkilxloc@opensuse.org,"Wed, 06 Aug 2008 01:25:03 +0100",[opensuse] installation via IPv6,"Hi all,

Could it be that during installation IPv6 is not enabled?
At work aswell as at home i've my own installation-server / gwdg-mirror.
Identical setup, but at home i use for all my vhosts an V6 address.

After a system is installed, i can upgrade or add aditional repo's
without any problem with my IPv6 servers.

However during the initial installation the installation source coming
froman IPv6 address are not recognised.

If i perform a DVD-installation, just before the first boot, i saw that
the module ""ipv6"" is not loaded. 
I presume this could be the reason.

Any suggestions how i can load this module in grub before installation
takes place, so that i can add my own installationsources?


Hans

Summary: DEP / NX causes Outlook to crash

Initial Comment:
When enabling the NX function underneath WinXP with 
SP2 RC2 (32 bit edition, not 64 bit windows), I was 
unable to start Outlook with the SpamBayes plug-in.  
After disabling and only disabling NX (remove /noexecute 
from boot.ini), it worked.  

Funny thing is that the owner of the company I work for 
developed a Bayesian spam filter as well and it had the 
same issue with the NX.  Not sure what the problem is, 
but the NX feature would be nice to turn on.  Does 
anyone know if NX can be disabled at the application 
level so that the other processes were protected with 
NX?

The DEP /NX issue is not restricted to Athlon chips. I am using an Intel
Core 2 Duo processor. When DEP is enabled via software in the System dialog
in Windows XP MCE (probably also applies to Windows Vista), Outlook fails
to load the plugin.

The web page text needs to remove the processor limitation.

I've tried a few basic Python programs packaged with py2exe 0.6.5 and
Python 2.4 with hardware DEP enabled on Windows XP SP2 on a newer Pentium-M
(with XD support) and on Windows Server 2003 on an Athlon 64 (with NX
support). Everything seems to work fine. I tried all of py2exe's bundle
options and couldn't get Windows to complain. The Python scripts I used for
testing only do simple arithmetic and make use of EasyDialogs for Windows
(which uses ctypes).

Does that mean you predict that any py2exe program would
fail to run?  If so, I'm happy to put together a ""hello
world"" program and attach it so people can verify that this
is the case.

Just noting that the Pythonwin issue appears related to the
dde module and this is not used by spambayes.  I'm therefore
back to suspecting py2exe.

A lot of people are hitting this these days, so changing the
summary in the hope that people will notice this bug and not
submit new ones (it's already in the FAQ).

Just had a report that Pythonwin also fails with this turned
on.  This makes it less likely the problem is simply py2exe.

another possibility is that py2exe is the culprit.  It isn't
obvious to me that is *is* the problem, but it certainly is
possible.  It would be interesting to know if the source
version of SpamBayes has the same problem.  When I get back
to Aus, I will try and reproduce this.

This is a problem with NX protection...this is how I got it to 
work:

There are ways to disable NX at application level:
a) Through the UI...
i) ""Control Panel"" > ""System""
ii) Click on the ""Advanced"" tab
iii) Under ""Performance"" section, click ""Settings""
iv) Click on the ""Data Execution Prevention"" tab
v) Click ""Add"" and select the appication you want to disable 
NX for

b) Registry...
Under ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows 
NT\\CurrentVersion\\AppCompatFlags\\Layers"" (there are 
equivalent HKEY_CURRENT_USER keys), create a new string 
key, its name being the full path to the executable file you 
want to disable NX for, the value being ""DisableNXShowUI""

.you'll notice that in the UI, only executable files can be 
added. This means that I had to select the ""Outlook.exe"" file 
to get Spambayes to work again. I tried adding the 
spambayes_addin.dll and the python23.dll paths to the registry 
as a workaround, but this didn't work...

Also, if you are using Outlook 2003, you may need to re-enable 
the plug-in by deleting its resilliency key (the COM Add-in 
Manager won't remember the re-enable setting no matter how 
many times you try):

FYI, the same techniques work with Inboxer etc. I'm guessing, 
as tim_one said, it's to do with the Python libraries.

You'll really have to ask about NX gimmicks on an Athlon list.

SpamBayes is written entirely in the Python programming 
language, and that never, ever tries to execute code from a 
data region (I'm very familiar with Python's implementation)   
My only guess is that Outlook itself, or MAPI, try to do this 
when interfacing with extensions.  Or Mark Hammond is 
playing disgusting games (the only kind he knows, really 
) in the win32all Python extensions.

"""Messom, Chris"" <k.p.twqqdt@massey.ac.nz>",user2.1@gvc.ceas-challenge.cc,"Wed, 06 Aug 2008 13:26:19 +1300",Time sheet,"Hi Tony,

Attached is the time sheet, we can bill the lecture and usual prep time
(was it 1 + 4 hours) to cover all the work for this last lecture.

We met Olivia yesterday with Samuel, at the indoor playground at the new
Westfield. Lily was enjoying the slides while Lara was getting her eyes
tested, seemed like Samuel was having fun too !

Cheers
Chris
